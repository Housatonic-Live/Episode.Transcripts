00:00.000 --> 00:11.360
I'm excited to see you, Mark Koulash is with us, he is a market intelligence analyst and

00:11.360 --> 00:23.160
IT specialist, but he has used all these qualities for investigating what's been going on in

00:23.160 --> 00:28.720
the last three and a half years, almost four years now, and even longer, because you also

00:28.800 --> 00:36.040
took a look into the past. So maybe could you introduce yourself a bit further so our audience

00:36.080 --> 00:43.880
knows who you are. And by the way, you work closely with Jonathan Kui, who we had with us

00:43.880 --> 00:47.960
in another session and who had very interesting things to tell.

00:50.080 --> 00:55.400
Thank you for very much for having me on, having me on as the audio satisfactory.

00:55.400 --> 01:01.960
Yes, it's very, it's very good. Very good. Thank you. So an introduction, my name is Mark

01:01.960 --> 01:09.040
Koolak. It's actually a Polish name. But within the United States, as name is shipped around so

01:09.040 --> 01:17.440
much, I'm actually more German, not Polish at all. So unfortunately, I wish I could

01:17.440 --> 01:23.880
converse with the audience here in German. But I've let some of my forefathers down by not

01:23.880 --> 01:31.920
having German in my back pocket in my suite of languages. But I worked in the how to say the

01:31.920 --> 01:39.360
computer industry, the big tech industry for about 22 to 23 years. I have a degree in computer

01:39.360 --> 01:47.040
engineering. And I worked predominantly in digital data storage for very large companies back

01:47.120 --> 01:57.440
Dell computer systems, EMC, which Dell acquired NetApp. And and several others. And I moved in my

01:57.440 --> 02:05.840
career as an engineer towards, towards eventually working as a technical trainer. And then as a

02:05.840 --> 02:10.680
sales engineer, and then eventually in product marketing and something called competitive

02:10.720 --> 02:17.800
intelligence, which sounds like it's a spy agency. But in reality, it's just understanding what

02:17.800 --> 02:23.200
a company's competitors are doing, and then helping develop sales literature and maybe make, you

02:23.200 --> 02:30.080
know, product roadmap decisions upon that. Having been an engineer, I tended to approach things

02:30.080 --> 02:35.760
in a pretty technical angle. So I live in the United States, so you can tell I'm a lifelong

02:35.760 --> 02:41.760
American. I live near between New York City and Boston, up in that northeastern part of the

02:41.760 --> 02:49.840
United States. And I've never really been someone who was very politically active or, you know,

02:49.840 --> 02:56.880
digging in on the issues of the day, if you will. But over the last 10 years, you know, my family

02:56.920 --> 03:04.080
as fortune would have it, had an encounter with drug addiction, which is a very big issue in the

03:04.080 --> 03:10.520
United States, and something I will talk more about throughout our show here, as well as

03:11.520 --> 03:20.760
something called Lyme disease or tick or arthropod born diseases, which are also very much on the

03:20.760 --> 03:27.680
rise in the United States. And my wife had some Lyme disease, which was chronic in the doctors. This

03:27.680 --> 03:32.840
is several years ago right now, eight, 10 years ago, simply did not want to acknowledge that her

03:32.840 --> 03:40.320
condition was real. So we had to find a doctor that would make, you know, antibiotics and other,

03:41.920 --> 03:46.560
how would you say, just come up with a strategy to help deal with that. So these things took me

03:46.560 --> 03:50.720
from someone who was sort of mining in those business, man, you know, doing the family thing

03:50.720 --> 03:58.880
and the career thing to why are these challenges being unaddressed? Why are they not even spoken

03:58.880 --> 04:05.680
about? And then I started to do more online research in my spare time. One thing led to the

04:05.680 --> 04:12.160
next, and it became to the point where I couldn't ethically continue my job anymore, because I was

04:12.160 --> 04:19.400
just spending so much time doing this online research. And I decided to do it full time in 2019. And

04:19.400 --> 04:26.840
then the pandemic happens. So I don't come at this. I'm, I'm very comfortable. I just don't think

04:26.840 --> 04:31.480
there's any value in trying to pretend to be something I'm not I'm not a molecular biologist. I'm

04:31.480 --> 04:39.920
not an immunologist. I was the lead competitive intelligence analyst for Dell Corporation for

04:39.920 --> 04:45.000
reverse engineering data storage systems that cost a million dollars or more. So I am from the

04:45.000 --> 04:51.800
corporate world, and I am very disciplined and regimented in my work. But that's what led me here.

04:52.280 --> 05:00.840
And yes, Jonathan Cooey who several it's amazing. I've been dealing with this. And you might have

05:00.840 --> 05:10.200
seen this as well. All of these, this whole area, this, this arena of combat of different influencers

05:10.200 --> 05:18.200
and ideas, and smaller parts of the story and narrative control. And it's taken me, I will

05:18.760 --> 05:25.880
years to really understand how all of this works. I was very naive early in the pandemic. I would

05:25.880 --> 05:33.320
even say that early in the pandemic, I was quite taken and fooled into participating in the wrong

05:33.320 --> 05:43.400
argument. And that was how to say promoting the idea of, Oh, there must have been a laboratory

05:43.400 --> 05:50.520
really, there must have been a gain of function element to this. And although there's no reason to

05:50.520 --> 05:56.200
discount anything, I've come to the realization that that's the wrong argument to have. And I was

05:56.200 --> 06:01.560
tricked into it. Perhaps I was predisposed because of my own personal experiences. But anyways,

06:01.560 --> 06:06.920
I have several topics I can address. And I, of course, I can happy to do a Q&A. But that's my

06:06.920 --> 06:13.720
background. Yeah, so the question is, would you like to give us like an overview of what you

06:13.720 --> 06:21.800
think that this pandemic has been about? And what's what has led up to it? I don't know if this is

06:21.800 --> 06:27.240
what you would like to do. I mean, with regards to these, these drug addiction, I don't know,

06:27.240 --> 06:34.440
maybe you are addressing the dystopian scandals also, because that is that is really quite,

06:34.440 --> 06:41.320
quite interesting that it was like in hidden in a painkiller, basically. And a lot of people got

06:41.320 --> 06:45.400
addicted to that. And actually, I, you know, I had a personal experience because a friend of mine,

06:45.960 --> 06:52.280
they were they had moved to America. And the husband of my friend went to the dentist. And after he

06:52.280 --> 06:58.440
had, I think they took out a tooth or so. And then he got this painkiller. And then the person said

06:58.440 --> 07:04.280
to him, the doctor, yeah, if you have pain, if you suffer from pain later on, just take it,

07:04.280 --> 07:09.400
no problem. It's an, you know, an easy product or something like that. And luckily, he didn't take

07:09.400 --> 07:14.600
it. Because later on, he looked at it and it turned out to be this like super highly addictive,

07:14.600 --> 07:22.120
herring kind of style product that maybe would have changed this is all path in life. Yeah,

07:22.120 --> 07:27.560
it's super dangerous. And it's very strange that this product has been admitted to the market at all.

07:27.560 --> 07:33.800
And then it was also, I think, even allowed, it got some some, you know, it was I think it's

07:33.800 --> 07:38.120
also applicable to to children now. Or was that some point?

07:39.400 --> 07:45.640
Well, thank you for sharing that experience. That is actually a very common route of painkiller

07:45.640 --> 07:52.520
addiction. First off, let me just clarify. And I think most people know this, but somehow we

07:52.520 --> 07:57.640
forget about it because of all the pollution from the media. Nobody wants to be a drug addict.

07:58.520 --> 08:05.320
Nobody, although I know Hollywood sometimes make it looks, you know, kind of rebellious and cool.

08:05.320 --> 08:11.400
Nobody wants to wind up living on a street, unable to support themselves and doing horrible things

08:11.400 --> 08:19.080
in order to support their habit. So there is, there's this misunderstanding. It's a result of

08:19.080 --> 08:28.200
laziness or or hedonism or something. It just isn't. Okay. And although there are an abundance of

08:28.200 --> 08:34.200
videos available, some cities of the United States of drug of drug addicts, all of those people are

08:34.200 --> 08:42.040
someone else's children. As as horrifying as their appearance may have become, and even the parents

08:42.040 --> 08:50.760
would agree, they're all kids from someone else anyways. So this is, it sounds like it's

08:51.560 --> 08:58.840
like a different topic. Okay. But if I may, I'll talk about the history of this a little bit.

08:58.840 --> 09:08.360
It's totally relevant, the history of course. But before we get into addressing that, why is it

09:08.360 --> 09:16.360
so specifically relevant to COVID? Well, every nation has had a different experience in the pandemic.

09:17.320 --> 09:26.120
In the United States, it has been said oftentimes that we've had approximately one million excess

09:26.120 --> 09:34.360
deaths. Excess death is a very complicated number. It means more people died than were

09:34.360 --> 09:39.480
projected to die. It doesn't mean more people died in the previous year. And then of course,

09:39.480 --> 09:44.040
well, how do you come up with that projection? Because if the projection is accurate enough,

09:44.040 --> 09:48.360
there will never be excess mortality. So it's a, it's a, it's a difficult measure.

09:48.920 --> 09:55.160
Nonetheless, more people did die quite a few over the last four or five years, four years at least.

09:56.120 --> 10:04.520
And in the United States, the total number of deaths from 2019 to 2023 of a drug overdose,

10:04.520 --> 10:11.400
and most of these were opioids or painkillers, was is over 500,000 right now, it's over half a

10:11.400 --> 10:19.000
million, which is a very big number for a country of 330 million people. In fact, for the year 2023,

10:19.640 --> 10:26.920
one out of every 30 people who died, period was a drug overdose, all ages, all reasons,

10:27.560 --> 10:35.080
yet it will not get the appropriate media attention. Now, there's always going to be reasons

10:35.080 --> 10:41.480
drug overdoses, accidents, there's so many causes. But to get a historical perspective,

10:42.440 --> 10:46.840
in the year 2000, the number of people that were dying in the United States per year of a drug

10:46.840 --> 10:54.120
overdose was about 22,000. Last year, it was 113,000.

10:55.080 --> 11:00.520
How is that possibly not something taken into account with respect to the excess number of

11:00.520 --> 11:08.520
people dying? And most of those people are under the age of 45. So it has an enormous impact on

11:08.520 --> 11:14.840
life expectancy calculations. And in the United States, it has been highlighted that life expectancy

11:14.920 --> 11:23.880
has been going down dot, dot, dot, because of the pandemic. However, most of the people who promote

11:24.520 --> 11:30.920
the or highlight how bad the pandemic was, whether it's from a cave or from a laboratory

11:30.920 --> 11:38.520
refused to mention this. Now, I was already predisposed to thinking about this several years ago, because

11:38.520 --> 11:43.720
of matter of fact, I myself became addicted at one point after I had a back operation.

11:44.280 --> 11:51.960
Fortunately, I did not turn into a long term thing. And then in 2022, we lost our son to a drug overdose

11:52.440 --> 11:59.800
in April. So the two year anniversary is coming up. And right now, my wife and I, we are full-time

11:59.800 --> 12:07.640
grandparents were raising our granddaughter. That was only five months old at the time that he died.

12:08.840 --> 12:14.920
So this is happening. This is, this is, I know this word is overused these days, but this is

12:14.920 --> 12:20.200
truly an epidemic. There are massive Facebook groups of thousands of grandparents right now

12:20.200 --> 12:28.680
raising multiple kids. And no one talks about this because because it would take, it would change

12:28.680 --> 12:34.600
how people think of the data of the pandemic. Perhaps many people have heard that in the United

12:34.600 --> 12:44.040
States, starting in 2020, there were a multitude of deaths which were reclassified as being COVID.

12:44.040 --> 12:50.600
So if someone, an elderly person dies of the flu, it's unfortunate as it is, we all wind up there.

12:52.040 --> 12:56.840
Hopefully at a very big number. But those deaths which were

12:57.640 --> 13:03.160
happen every year, because people reach the end of their life. Some of those were reclassified

13:03.160 --> 13:08.840
as having been COVID deaths. Now I disagree with that strategy, but that's what was done.

13:10.120 --> 13:19.080
Calling one type of death, another type of death does not, in and of itself, cause any excess deaths.

13:19.080 --> 13:25.160
You can call shark attacks, people falling off of ladders and car accidents COVID deaths.

13:25.800 --> 13:33.480
That doesn't actually itself kill anyone. So in the United States, as all of these other causes of

13:33.480 --> 13:41.240
death, were called COVID, we had more people dying. And the very, very simple analysis,

13:41.800 --> 13:48.440
which we are told to accept is that because more people died and because we've had more COVID deaths,

13:48.440 --> 13:55.960
therefore all the COVID deaths must be new and excess deaths. And that's it.

13:56.680 --> 14:05.960
And Jonathan Cooe does a fantastic job. I'm so thankful he brings this up. When we had all of

14:05.960 --> 14:12.440
these excess people dying of drug overdoses, well, where did that fit in? If you look back,

14:12.520 --> 14:20.040
if you use the 2000 number, and if you have, let's just say 300,000 excess deaths from drug

14:20.040 --> 14:26.680
overdoses, how is that not factored in? And the point is that they don't want you to factor that

14:26.680 --> 14:35.400
in, whether it be Anthony Fauci or the World Health Organization, or the so-called truth and expose

14:35.400 --> 14:40.360
whatever movement, the medical movement, they will not allow you, at least with the US, they

14:40.680 --> 14:48.040
mention this because it will change how you view this. So we have undoubtedly had an excess

14:48.040 --> 14:53.560
number of people dying. We've undoubtedly have had more younger people dying. These are unquestionable,

14:53.560 --> 15:02.040
but why? Now note, I made no statement that there's no pandemic. It is impossible for me to ever

15:02.040 --> 15:08.200
prove that there isn't a leaf or rock somewhere that's hiding the SARS-O virus. It's impossible to

15:08.200 --> 15:14.280
ever make a statement that nobody died of a new virus. So I don't entertain that.

15:14.840 --> 15:21.000
What I do say, though, is that when looking at all of the new reasons why people have died,

15:21.000 --> 15:27.400
including a massive surge in drug overdose deaths, of course, hospital protocols, denying people

15:27.400 --> 15:35.320
access to antibiotics because they had a viral pneumonia, viral, whatever, have all killed excess

15:35.320 --> 15:42.760
people. And when you factor all of these things out, you're just not left with a million people

15:42.760 --> 15:49.160
that could have possibly died of COVID. So why is the entire conversation about is there COVID or

15:49.160 --> 15:58.120
not? It's the wrong argument to have. Historically, and I'll just go down the historical path a

15:58.200 --> 16:01.400
little bit, and then we can see where we are.

16:02.840 --> 16:10.280
Sometime in the late 1990s, synthetic opioids were introduced to the market of the United States

16:10.280 --> 16:16.520
by a company called Purdue Pharma. And I mean, painkillers have been around forever.

16:17.880 --> 16:22.440
They are a wonderful tool. Imagine how many people have had horrible injuries,

16:22.440 --> 16:28.760
unfortunately from war, car accidents or whatever, that surgeries have been able because of painkillers,

16:28.760 --> 16:35.480
morphine and heroin, so on, are wonderful tools. They have a place they're not evil. They can be

16:35.480 --> 16:44.920
misused. The natural medicines, although addictive, are not nearly as addictive as the synthetic,

16:44.920 --> 16:50.280
the heavily processed ones and things like OxyContin are extraordinarily addictive.

16:51.080 --> 16:57.720
I don't care how strong your faith is. It is they cause chemical damage to your system

16:57.720 --> 17:03.560
that will make you simply want more of them. And although they can be used responsibly,

17:04.200 --> 17:11.160
they need to be respected. Just like using a sushi knife, you can't just

17:11.160 --> 17:16.200
slice and things up in your kitchen. You have to respect that blade. It's not the blade in

17:16.200 --> 17:23.400
of itself, though, it's bad. Anyways, so the number of prescriptions and uses of these drugs

17:23.400 --> 17:30.840
have just gone up and up and up. And starting around 1999, 2000, and very slowly, the number of

17:30.840 --> 17:38.440
people who are dying of drug overdoses crept from 20,000 a year, in the year 2000, all the way up

17:38.440 --> 17:49.960
to 113,000 are record year in 2023. These has an enormous impact on life expectancy.

17:51.080 --> 17:54.760
Of course, it's going to have a major impact in demographics of the United States.

17:55.640 --> 18:04.600
And I believe this data has been misused to fuel, as part, in part, the pandemic narrative.

18:05.480 --> 18:11.960
And although it seems how could they possibly be related? These things seem different. Maybe

18:11.960 --> 18:20.840
it's just a coincidence. Okay, I will offer you this. The Purdue pharma, which is recently no

18:20.840 --> 18:27.240
longer open. Other companies are making those drugs, so they've been sued. The family that

18:27.240 --> 18:32.040
created that was a family called the Sackler family, S-A-C-K L-E-R. And you can read a lot

18:32.680 --> 18:40.200
about the Sackler family. When the patriarch of that family died, Raymond Sackler,

18:41.480 --> 18:46.040
if you look at the people who were his best friends and speaking at the funeral, one of them was,

18:46.040 --> 18:53.800
first one was Joshua Laderberg, who was perhaps America's foremost person with respect to history

18:53.800 --> 18:58.600
on the development of biological weapons. He coined the phrase microbiome and emerging

18:58.680 --> 19:04.520
diseases, Joshua Laderberg did. He passed in 2007 to 2008, I think. And the other one was a

19:04.520 --> 19:10.280
Dr. Phil Sharp of MIT, who stars student Melissa Moore as the Chief Science Officer of Moderna.

19:11.240 --> 19:17.960
So I openly speculate about the possibility that some of this transition to synthetic opioids,

19:17.960 --> 19:25.960
an engineered epidemic, epidemic of killing people with drugs, was perhaps allowed because

19:25.960 --> 19:31.720
to transition to this new era of genomics, big data analytics, gene therapy, and so on,

19:31.720 --> 19:37.960
there needed to be a pandemic. And if you listen to the scientist talk that the greatest accomplishment

19:39.160 --> 19:45.880
since the wheel has been gene therapy, why wouldn't they consider the possibility of killing a few

19:45.880 --> 19:53.080
hundred thousand people to create the data for a pandemic to get us there? I have no trouble

19:53.080 --> 20:00.360
doing that. So I've just tied several things together. I don't have proof, but I'm the fact

20:00.360 --> 20:06.840
that there is this unwillingness, even in the truth movement, to talk about this, I think is

20:06.840 --> 20:13.880
evidence that it is relevant. It is relevant. But I think it's evidence that there's multiple

20:13.880 --> 20:20.440
parties involved in hiding the role and impact of this drug epidemic in the United States.

20:21.400 --> 20:30.200
Can I ask you, the way this drug is structured, could it be also produced in a way so that it's

20:30.200 --> 20:37.240
not that addictive, but still has the same results, that it really takes away your pain and so on.

20:37.240 --> 20:41.720
But this seems to go further. It's not only pain killing, but as you said, it makes you

20:41.720 --> 20:51.160
agree for more. But has anyone ever looked at the structure of this specific drug,

20:51.160 --> 20:57.320
so that it creates this need to have more of it?

20:59.880 --> 21:08.040
Well, long-term opioid use of any type, natural or not, is definitely going to

21:08.920 --> 21:16.040
lead to a less effective economy at the very least. However, history has shown that the,

21:16.920 --> 21:24.040
for example, the morphine and heroin used in previous wars, World War II, Vietnam,

21:24.040 --> 21:33.560
well, it definitely led to addictions. Many troops, many US servicemen who went to Vietnam War,

21:33.640 --> 21:37.640
who had trouble with heroin addictions coming back, were able to quit.

21:39.160 --> 21:44.840
The success rate of quitting addiction to these synthetics is very different.

21:47.400 --> 21:53.800
I can't chemically describe it, but from what I've been able to study about addiction overall,

21:53.800 --> 22:00.120
is that these neurological pathways, believe it or not, are actually very similar

22:00.760 --> 22:09.000
across a wide variety of addictions, whether it be pornography or gambling or even opioids.

22:09.560 --> 22:19.000
Once the brain no longer develops this pathway of illogically going back and producing the same

22:19.000 --> 22:25.000
behavior, even though it has no beneficial results whatsoever, it's interesting. It's like what

22:25.000 --> 22:30.520
are finding a way through a dam, no matter how much caulking you put into the hole,

22:30.520 --> 22:36.520
the water just keeps wanting to go through it. These synthetic opioids just burst open these

22:36.520 --> 22:49.560
paths, and it's very, very difficult to get back. What tends to happen is that the things like

22:49.560 --> 22:55.160
oxycontin are highly addictive, but eventually, as the addiction gets worse, people want more.

22:56.280 --> 23:03.960
There are more and more powerful versions of these opiates. One is called fentanyl. I'm sure you've

23:03.960 --> 23:12.280
heard of it, which is extremely powerful and also very little is required to cause a fatal overdose.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.680
Another one is called cart fentanyl, which is even more powerful. That's actually used as a

23:16.680 --> 23:23.720
tranquilizer for elephants. This stuff is relatively abundantly available. It's used in hospice.

23:25.000 --> 23:33.480
It is used by veterinarians or animals, so it's not as if it's impossible to find. I know

23:35.000 --> 23:41.560
it's often mischaracterized in the United States as a foreign, as an international border issue.

23:42.440 --> 23:50.680
While that is an element of it, you'd be surprised to find that many families that have direct

23:51.240 --> 23:56.440
interactions with this stuff and knowledge will actually encourage people to not think about it

23:56.440 --> 24:04.600
solely as a border issue. For adults or for anyone who becomes addicted, if you,

24:05.480 --> 24:09.400
since it's very difficult to get actual oxycontin after your prescription runs out,

24:10.360 --> 24:16.440
what will happen is you can find the even more concentrated stuff available,

24:16.440 --> 24:21.800
usually very inexpensively on the street, outside of a doctor for less and less money.

24:24.920 --> 24:29.800
Another issue is that this fentanyl, because it's relatively cheap and abundant,

24:30.760 --> 24:40.280
there are parties within the United States that have produced artificial prescription pills,

24:41.080 --> 24:50.360
such as Xanax or other things which people would prescribe for other neurological conditions,

24:50.360 --> 24:55.000
et cetera, depression. They will make these things in their garage with a very simple

24:55.080 --> 25:00.040
press with the powders, they'll press it in, and then these bags of pills will pop up,

25:00.920 --> 25:07.320
and sometimes kids will do something stupid to go to a party. They go, oh, here's this type of pill.

25:08.200 --> 25:13.400
I saw this on a movie somewhere. Let's take a few and be stupid kids, and there have actually

25:13.400 --> 25:17.880
been overdoses of children in the United States that weren't addicts at all. They simply didn't,

25:18.760 --> 25:26.040
I mean, kids do stupid things, right? Unfortunately, I never quite did that as a kid. I did other

25:26.040 --> 25:33.000
stupid things though, but these risks exist, and although I am not the person who's going to give

25:33.000 --> 25:40.600
you the solutions to this stuff, I know that the very first part of any solution is public awareness,

25:40.600 --> 25:47.160
public acknowledgement of how big the role is, public acknowledgement of how this stuff finds

25:47.160 --> 25:53.160
its way to people, acknowledgement of how severe and quick the addictions can start as little as

25:53.160 --> 26:01.000
two to three days of use of some of these prescriptions, and that's the very first step. Long-term,

26:01.880 --> 26:05.560
it's very complicated. I know there's weaker families within the United States. There's all

26:05.560 --> 26:10.680
these other chemicals which are being bombarded with, and I'm not saying that it's someone else's

26:10.680 --> 26:17.800
problem. We actually, it's all of our problems in a way, but nothing changes without the very

26:17.800 --> 26:25.880
least recognition of the threat. And again, I believe that public discussion of this is being

26:27.000 --> 26:34.200
discouraged because it dares to impact the interpretation of the data that is being seen

26:34.760 --> 26:38.680
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. I think it is a big part of it, not all of it,

26:39.640 --> 26:47.480
but in this, how are you saying, a component that cannot be ignored responsibly?

26:48.120 --> 26:53.000
And do you know what I find interesting? I mean, here you see the same pattern as with the

26:53.880 --> 26:59.640
the vaccine, so-called vaccination. You have a basically a very dangerous product in the market,

26:59.640 --> 27:05.080
and instead of taking it off the market once the issues occurs, because that cannot be

27:05.160 --> 27:12.200
happening behind the doors or invisible to decision-makers in the US, like the FDA or something,

27:12.200 --> 27:17.800
you know, other entities who could like cry out and say, hey, we have a major problem. And instead,

27:17.800 --> 27:23.560
they're not pointing, as you said, to the oranges of the problem. And with corona, we have the same

27:23.560 --> 27:33.640
thing. So it's a treatment with results that are becoming more and more obvious as being

27:33.640 --> 27:37.640
dangerous, and it's not taking off the market. It's the same thing. Instead, it's maybe like,

27:37.640 --> 27:42.840
I mean, it's now even rolled out to serve kids. I mean, you know, that's the opposite of what

27:42.840 --> 27:49.240
you'd expect of like a responsible decision-maker in this kind of, in this very important field

27:49.240 --> 27:58.280
of health, like to the population. I completely agree. It is possible that there could be great

27:58.280 --> 28:03.160
benefits in the future to some of these new medical technologies. I don't discount that.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.040
I encourage the research and development and the exploration. And if people want to

28:08.680 --> 28:14.280
sign up for trials, by all means, as long as the right risk profile is shared with them.

28:15.000 --> 28:22.920
However, in this case, if a proper analysis was done considering hospital protocols,

28:22.920 --> 28:33.080
considering other ongoing concurrent epidemics, such as the drug epidemic, there would not have

28:33.080 --> 28:39.960
been a condition to facilitate the rollout of these new pharmaceuticals in the first place.

28:41.080 --> 28:46.200
So while discussion of their danger is absolutely warranted,

28:49.640 --> 28:54.200
it is appropriate to ask that they really serve any benefit in the first place.

28:55.080 --> 29:04.680
And I would suggest that the answer is no. So you can't make something safe

29:06.120 --> 29:13.320
if it doesn't solve anything in the first place. So why doesn't the discussion just stop right

29:13.320 --> 29:17.960
there as opposed to, well, there seems to be more myocarditis or whatever. I don't know. I haven't

29:17.960 --> 29:23.160
done the full breakdown of the vaccine. I'm thankful for the people who have. But I would just look

29:23.160 --> 29:30.680
at the base data. And again, why is it openly, people are openly allowed to say,

29:30.680 --> 29:35.560
oh, this vaccine is out there to kill people. Oh, this vaccine is out there to do this, to do that,

29:35.560 --> 29:45.560
whatever. No discussion is allowed of protocols or other ongoing epidemics.

29:45.560 --> 29:54.280
Well, I've come, can I ask you these drugs that Mark mentioned, are these also available in

29:54.280 --> 30:00.760
Germany, because or like in Europe, because we do, I mean, I'm not really, I don't know. But like,

30:00.760 --> 30:09.560
I had assumed that this is not, you know, as an sort of drug epidemic, as you know, here,

30:10.520 --> 30:18.760
compared to the US. You know, it's a great point. It varies nation to nation by a

30:18.760 --> 30:23.880
variety, due to a variety of things. There are nations that actually have it worse than the

30:23.880 --> 30:30.040
United States. I've heard this. I verified it last night coincidentally. Pakistan is actually

30:30.040 --> 30:37.080
amongst the worst countries in the world. Now, I know that's a shocking number for some reason

30:37.080 --> 30:41.480
where we are predisposed to thinking that Islamic nations perhaps that lower drug use.

30:42.520 --> 30:50.520
Pakistan has, I think, 700 people dying a day of a drug overdose 700. I think their population

30:50.520 --> 30:59.640
is 140 million. Someone can check that. It's up there. But 700 a day. That's that means in,

30:59.640 --> 31:04.920
like in two weeks, they've had more deaths from that than Ebola in Africa in the last 10 years.

31:05.720 --> 31:12.360
So why does that get no attention? Now, of course, again, because of a variety of social

31:12.360 --> 31:18.440
challenges that Pakistan has, perhaps they have a large population of males that just don't feel

31:18.440 --> 31:23.720
so they have much of a future. I don't know. I'm not the person to comment on that. But there are

31:23.720 --> 31:28.680
other countries that have very, very, very low drug use. Is it now? Is it a difference because of

31:29.640 --> 31:38.760
pharmaceutical controls? Is it culture? Is it age? I don't know why that is. Canada, in some areas of

31:38.760 --> 31:45.000
Canada, the number of drug overdose deaths per day is almost as high as it is in the United States.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.840
And some other areas of Canada, it's very low. Perhaps it'll be alcohol or something else.

31:51.960 --> 31:58.600
I can't quite describe all of that. And one thing I've noticed, perhaps you've seen this as well.

31:58.680 --> 32:04.840
Right? I know Germany has its unique characteristics of what has gone on during the pandemic and

32:05.960 --> 32:13.080
all the things. I'm not even going to list right now. But as an American,

32:14.200 --> 32:19.880
put forward the challenges of my country and how I see it. I am oftentimes said, well, hold on,

32:19.880 --> 32:24.520
hold on. Portugal had this problem over here. So how can you overlook it?

32:24.520 --> 32:31.080
I can barely get people in my own country to understand the challenges in my own country.

32:31.640 --> 32:37.640
I'm not in a position to go over the challenges in the other 199 nations on the planet. And I know

32:37.640 --> 32:46.920
that they're there. But what I've seen is for as an American to overlook challenges in my country

32:46.920 --> 32:54.440
based upon how things perhaps have gone in other nations. And again, I appreciate people wanting

32:54.440 --> 33:00.680
to look at a bigger picture. But I don't know. I mean, Portugal, for example, there is a narrative

33:00.680 --> 33:05.400
that Portugal had a high number of COVID deaths. A lot of people show up at the hospital in this

33:05.400 --> 33:13.640
and that and maybe I can't disprove that or prove it. But what I do know is that until the most

33:13.640 --> 33:19.880
important problems right in front of me in my own country are solved, I can't change how I attack

33:20.840 --> 33:25.720
the list of priorities because of what happened in that one hospital in Portugal.

33:26.360 --> 33:31.960
So I'm not trying to be rude about it. But I think people really just need to sometimes just

33:31.960 --> 33:36.920
look at the data right in front of them and act accordingly, supposed to being told what they

33:36.920 --> 33:43.240
shouldn't should not focus on by everything else nor. But yes, there are other countries that have

33:43.240 --> 33:48.120
it worse. And I think there's a variety of conditions that have led into that.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.840
Wolfgang, you know about the German situation.

33:53.800 --> 33:59.480
I was sorry. I just, you know, I'm asking him. I guess you know him.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.480
By the way, thank you. It's an honor to be on a webcast with you. Thank you for all the work

34:05.480 --> 34:13.080
you've done and for being an early voice standing up. It took several of us a while to get to the

34:13.080 --> 34:19.160
same point because we were all predisposed to thinking different things, right? But I'm so

34:19.160 --> 34:22.200
thankful for the work you did. And thank you for still being in this fight with us.

34:23.080 --> 34:29.800
You know, the comparing the states how they handle the drugs is very interesting. I think

34:29.800 --> 34:35.080
I did not do it very thoroughly. But I know that in Germany, we have a very restrictive law

34:35.640 --> 34:43.000
that several drugs which are which make addictions that they are regulated in a special way that

34:43.000 --> 34:49.240
doctors have to use special prescription formulas to prescribe them. And they are each formulas

34:49.240 --> 34:55.880
registered. And so it's easy to control which doctor does it. When I was in the public health

34:55.880 --> 35:01.000
office, there was there was some doctors who were just doing it, you nevertheless. And they were

35:01.560 --> 35:08.680
attracting drug addicts by giving them very often those. But you can just go into the pharmacy. And

35:08.680 --> 35:14.440
when you see, you draw, see the drawer where the drugs are. And you see the recipes all come from

35:14.440 --> 35:22.600
one doctor. And you go to the doctor and have a talk with him. You know, and you can stop this.

35:22.600 --> 35:28.840
So it's not so in Germany, it's easier to control. There is a black market for sure. And there are

35:29.240 --> 35:35.320
sold which are which are smuggled and whatever. And there are falsified drugs everywhere in there.

35:35.320 --> 35:41.000
They mix something and they say sell it very toxic stuff sometimes. But I think there are not,

35:41.000 --> 35:47.960
there's not such a problem as it is in US. But I wanted to comment on another thing that

35:47.960 --> 35:54.200
if there is in some hospital in Portugal, or if there is only in New York, suddenly such an amount

35:54.200 --> 36:01.320
of people dying in April 2020 or so. Or when there is in North Italy, suddenly,

36:01.320 --> 36:09.320
a spot where so many people die in in San Francisco, you see nothing. If there's nothing like that,

36:09.880 --> 36:15.720
this cannot be a pandemic virus. This is very sure if there is really a pandemic virus,

36:15.720 --> 36:20.200
which is spreading with all the airplanes with the spreading with all the traffic all over the

36:20.280 --> 36:27.560
world, then you would not see spots where people are killed like with Minazulam in England.

36:27.560 --> 36:33.720
You can see the prescription of this of this diatsipam of this tranquilizer. And in the same

36:33.720 --> 36:38.360
time, you see the people dying in hospitals at the same time, in the same amount. And again,

36:38.360 --> 36:43.160
a little bit less. And again, the prescription a little bit less. You see directly connection

36:43.160 --> 36:49.640
between the amount of drugs prescribed in hospitals and people dying in those hospitals.

36:49.640 --> 36:57.160
So and only in those hospitals. So, and it's I think it's a very, very, very hard data

36:57.160 --> 37:02.120
that shows it's not that I forget about viruses and look for the other reasons.

37:02.840 --> 37:09.240
And I'm glad you've mentioned New York City. Jessica Hockett, of course, I hope you have or

37:09.240 --> 37:17.080
will talk with her within the United States made an observation that there was a high number of

37:17.640 --> 37:25.880
within this month of April, 2020 in New York City, emergency medic or ambulance responses.

37:27.000 --> 37:32.040
And people who were considered to be classified as having died in their house,

37:32.920 --> 37:39.560
or were dead upon arrival. Hopefully I'm characterizing this right to a New York City hospital. Now,

37:40.440 --> 37:46.200
one change that New York City made. Wasn't in that month of April, 2020.

37:47.240 --> 37:52.920
Was I'm gonna say an order, but the very least a strong recommendation.

37:54.200 --> 38:03.880
To be careful who an emergency response person would would revive. Because of the possibility

38:03.880 --> 38:12.200
that reviving someone could spread the virus. Now, so there are several cases that Jessica

38:12.200 --> 38:16.680
Hockett has found where there was like a 33 year old who was dead in their apartment.

38:17.720 --> 38:26.520
And it's marked as a COVID death. Now, again, I can't look at every molecule that ever existed

38:26.520 --> 38:31.240
on a planet and say there's no such thing as a COVID molecule that causes someone to just die

38:31.320 --> 38:39.000
in their bed. However, the profile of that person looks like someone that may have been

38:39.000 --> 38:45.240
in the midst of a drug addiction. Perhaps they were in a case where they needed an emergency response.

38:46.440 --> 38:52.840
And they were not given whatever emergency therapy was needed to bring them back.

38:52.840 --> 38:58.600
Because of this emergency declaration and these special ways of handling it. So,

38:59.560 --> 39:05.320
now you have this, if you want to fuel the pandemic narrative, you have this wonderful data

39:05.320 --> 39:11.800
of 30 year olds just dying in their apartment. Oh, it's it's COVID. And this is enough again to

39:11.800 --> 39:17.080
create this cascade of well, it's must be even worse than we thought. Therefore, we need more

39:17.080 --> 39:26.200
lockdowns, more emergencies. Now we need more therapeutics and vaccines and so on. But what

39:26.200 --> 39:32.200
you said, again, I don't want to offload all responsibilities to doctors. Okay, there are

39:32.200 --> 39:36.920
communities with the United States that have had very low levels of drug addiction. They have very

39:36.920 --> 39:46.680
strong families, strong faith, etc. So it's not purely a doctor thing. However, and I think people

39:46.680 --> 39:53.160
need to be aware, right? If I think most people know you don't give a four year old keys to your car,

39:53.240 --> 39:56.920
right? There's just certain things you just know, because you can understand the risks.

39:58.200 --> 40:03.720
But people don't realize how serious the risks can be of the addictiveness of some of these

40:03.720 --> 40:12.920
painkillers, which have a role. But without people being involved or having the knowledge to act

40:12.920 --> 40:18.040
appropriately, these addictions are created. So I don't want the doctors to have that much power,

40:18.040 --> 40:24.280
but the same time, there are cases such as Germany, you see the addiction rates are much lower,

40:25.080 --> 40:30.680
perhaps because in this case, the the extra controls are warranted.

40:31.800 --> 40:37.400
Oh, it's a very it's a it's a big discussion to have. But again, this explains the differences

40:37.400 --> 40:44.920
between nations. It's very interesting. The WHO has made, has said there were many pandemics

40:44.920 --> 40:51.080
already, they had many pandemics, and they are preparing the nations now. They are

40:51.080 --> 40:55.000
if we're doing it for some years, or if for a certain new kind of pandemic,

40:56.760 --> 41:07.560
non diseases that cannot be transmitted to others. And how do they say non contaminating or non

41:07.880 --> 41:13.320
infectious, contagious, infectious and infectious? Yes. And they they,

41:13.960 --> 41:22.040
and they call it, and they they they prepare this, and they were defined with what new pandemic

41:22.040 --> 41:29.640
from NCDs will come. And I'm curious why they did not mention up to now, it is not a topic,

41:29.640 --> 41:36.040
this addiction. WHO doesn't speak about that, they speak about obesity, they speak about alcoholism,

41:36.040 --> 41:41.880
they speak about cigarettes, but they don't speak about those those drugs, those painkiller

41:41.880 --> 41:47.640
drugs. They didn't have it on their on their agenda, although it's a big elephant in the room.

41:50.200 --> 41:58.200
There are some scientists and policy advisors who will mention it. And

42:00.520 --> 42:05.000
are you familiar with the United States, the former director of our Centers of Disease Control,

42:05.000 --> 42:12.600
Dr. Redfield? Have you heard of that name before? Well, he was our former director of our CDC.

42:13.320 --> 42:19.960
He is he's been in this business for a long time. And I gave him a lot of credit for emphasizing

42:19.960 --> 42:25.560
many times last several years. He's no longer in the role that this was one of the greatest

42:25.560 --> 42:31.720
challenges of the United States. Okay. Now, of course, he was completely ignored by our main

42:32.520 --> 42:39.240
news sources. But Redfield, of course, when the pandemic started, he plays a lot, right, with it

42:39.240 --> 42:49.960
as well. I sometimes believe that there are officials who perhaps feel as though that if they

42:51.160 --> 42:57.800
participate a little in the show, right, that maybe by staying in the role, they can help

42:58.520 --> 43:05.480
steer attention towards other things. Maybe there may be there, it helps. Maybe,

43:06.440 --> 43:10.680
maybe dozens, I don't know, but there are officials that have stated this. But I'll tell you what,

43:10.680 --> 43:18.040
even if someone were to say it, it's ignored. Former US President Donald Trump has met several

43:18.120 --> 43:28.200
times with, let's just say, an association here in that I live near that supports families that

43:28.200 --> 43:34.600
have lost children to drug overdoses. And they found Trump to be extremely receptive to this.

43:36.280 --> 43:42.120
Trump tried several times to pass additional legislation and was completely incapable of.

43:42.760 --> 43:49.960
He was almost ridiculed for it. Now, the drug crisis got worse after the Trump administration.

43:49.960 --> 43:55.080
So I'm not saying that Trump was a successful president in this. If you just look at the data,

43:55.080 --> 44:02.760
he failed. All right. However, even his attempts to talk about it were ridiculed by mainstream

44:02.760 --> 44:11.080
media. And to this day, they're still completely overlooked. So in the WHO,

44:12.600 --> 44:16.440
I refuse to believe that everyone in the World Health Organization is a bad person.

44:17.960 --> 44:22.040
I'm sure that there are other individuals of the WHO. If you look at some of the

44:23.080 --> 44:28.920
throughout their website that highlight this, but ultimately their main message is filtered

44:28.920 --> 44:35.160
somewhere. And the message is just not allowed to talk about this. And it's a shame. There are

44:35.160 --> 44:42.280
health organization, their role should be to advocate health to raise awareness of health risks.

44:43.880 --> 44:49.480
Conceptually, it could be a good thing, but they only allow people to focus on one thing.

44:50.120 --> 44:55.800
And these vaccines have had this great discussion before. Perhaps they wouldn't have been pushed on

44:55.800 --> 45:01.080
people if people understand the whole profile of health risks. We want to

45:02.600 --> 45:08.360
research gene therapy, the treat cancers and tumors. That's fantastic. I support it. I'm an

45:08.360 --> 45:14.760
engineer. I support it. But this stuff is very experimental still. It's still just a speculation

45:14.760 --> 45:21.640
that it could ever work. But to just push it on the whole world by not allowing a full discussion

45:21.640 --> 45:28.280
of everything, everything from engineered food, drug addictions, societal ills, family breakdowns,

45:29.640 --> 45:33.720
all of this horrible stuff that's on the internet, et cetera, all of these things combined.

45:35.080 --> 45:42.360
It's irresponsible. It's unfortunate. And I'm trying to have an approach to this that I would

45:42.360 --> 45:48.760
inspire other people, as opposed to just having a pure conspiratorial approach to it. And I'm

45:48.760 --> 45:55.240
feeling positive as time goes on, that I think we've been turning a corner. I think we're having

45:55.240 --> 46:02.120
really good rational discussion about reflecting back on the pandemic now. Regarding what you just

46:02.120 --> 46:08.280
said, Doctor, about the next pandemic, disease X or whatever it is. Yes, I've heard it. And

46:08.280 --> 46:12.680
I've expected nothing less than another pandemic.

46:13.640 --> 46:18.760
Well, so what is your take? You mentioned the Lyme disease. So what's your take on that?

46:21.160 --> 46:27.240
To review Lyme disease, it's a very well known within North America, United States and Canada,

46:27.240 --> 46:33.960
and other countries. It is a immune system deficiency, which seems to be cause associated with

46:34.920 --> 46:45.000
Arthur Potter, tick-borne illnesses. And it's named after a small town in the state of Connecticut,

46:45.000 --> 46:50.520
not too far from New York City called Lyme, old Lyme, Connecticut, where it was first discovered

46:50.520 --> 47:00.600
in the mid 1970s. It's very easy to trace the epidemiology of this to a animal infectious

47:00.600 --> 47:05.640
disease research facility called Plum Island, which is very, very close to there,

47:06.680 --> 47:13.240
which I believe most likely had an accidental release of some non-native tick species,

47:14.040 --> 47:22.200
which perhaps hosted some artificially injected bacterium. Now, early in the pandemic, I was

47:22.200 --> 47:28.680
tricked into thinking that that was the evidence that SARS was real and SARS was from a laboratory.

47:28.680 --> 47:34.920
It took me over a year to think more about that and realize that I was perhaps being misled.

47:36.760 --> 47:44.520
It's still not clear to me how much of that, although I know that that illness is real.

47:44.520 --> 47:49.880
They've seen these very, the illness itself is actually a type of bacterium called aspyracate,

47:50.600 --> 47:57.080
which is very corkscrewed and very much similar to syphilis in many ways. In fact, in the United

47:57.080 --> 48:08.280
States, there has been some research done and a very high percentage of people that have done

48:08.280 --> 48:15.240
autopsies that have died of things like Alzheimer's and other long-term neurological degeneration

48:15.240 --> 48:19.640
have had undiagnosed forms of syphilis, whether it be Lyme or something else.

48:20.440 --> 48:26.440
So I think it is real, but the question is, is how much of this is to blame on the bacterium

48:27.240 --> 48:32.520
how much of it is because we have weaker immune systems now than perhaps we did 20 years ago.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.600
And I didn't really factor that in at the beginning of the pandemic, but

48:37.800 --> 48:43.800
if these organisms, which have existed for a long time are real, I don't see how it's possible

48:43.800 --> 48:47.880
that North America could have been inhabited by Native American country, Native American,

48:47.880 --> 48:55.240
First Nation Americans for 10,000 years without all dying. So possibly combinations of our foods

48:55.240 --> 49:02.920
and childhood immunizations have weakened our immune system so that while Lyme disease is a

49:02.920 --> 49:10.440
challenge, it's not just Lyme disease. It actually speaks to our bigger weakening of our overall health.

49:11.560 --> 49:17.800
I think we have a new image as soon as we have some new possibility of diagnosis.

49:18.520 --> 49:21.240
There were ticks all the way in all forests everywhere.

49:22.040 --> 49:26.520
And there were people with rheumatism, they called it rheumatism, they got nervous diseases,

49:26.520 --> 49:32.120
but they didn't have a diagnosis. So maybe Borreliosis, how we call Lyme disease,

49:33.480 --> 49:40.280
Borreliosis, yes. It's a very ancient disease, but it was never diagnosed because we had no

49:40.280 --> 49:48.200
possibility to find it. Yes. We know bacteria that they are the reason for such diseases.

49:48.200 --> 49:54.360
We know for now 100 and I don't know 50, 70 years or so, it's not so long that we have the

49:54.360 --> 50:00.360
possibility to find those small bacteria. Now we know viruses, there's still more recent,

50:01.560 --> 50:07.000
it's even 100 years or so, the first time someone thought of viruses, and now they're trying those

50:07.000 --> 50:14.600
nuclei, those genetic, the molecule trying to find out the molecules, but they don't know

50:15.560 --> 50:24.040
all the things going on in nature with all those bacteria, viruses, and what else is there,

50:24.040 --> 50:29.080
which are all communicating, and which are there long before we thought of them. For sure, they

50:29.080 --> 50:34.680
are there for thousands of years, and you can find them in human beings, you find the traces

50:34.680 --> 50:42.040
in our genomes. We have contacts with all those microbeology. We were developed with them,

50:42.600 --> 50:47.320
and now suddenly there are people who have new instruments to find something very small,

50:47.320 --> 50:52.600
and they're very specialized on this, and they say, oh, I find something, and I'm making vaccine

50:52.600 --> 51:00.360
against this. It's so stupid, it's so narrow-minded. The way we look at that is so narrow-minded,

51:00.360 --> 51:05.400
and we should be much more calm with all those infectious diseases, because if it's an

51:05.400 --> 51:10.600
infectious disease, it comes from something which is there as long as human beings are there.

51:11.240 --> 51:17.720
In varieties, human beings change, viruses change, bacteria change, but this is a system

51:17.720 --> 51:24.760
which is communicating with the immune system. Very some hundred years ago, it was the first

51:24.760 --> 51:29.800
term that people from the continent, Europe, went to other continents. It's not a long time

51:29.800 --> 51:35.480
for human history as human beings, and then there was all those contacts with the aeroplanes coming

51:35.480 --> 51:40.760
from China, coming from everywhere, mixing all the bacteria, mixing all the viruses globally,

51:40.760 --> 51:46.600
and we still live. There were new ones. There were hundreds of new ones we never had contact with,

51:46.600 --> 51:51.560
which only lived in some Indonesia or in the forest or somewhere, and suddenly we had tourists

51:51.560 --> 51:58.600
there, and we survived. Our immune system is able to get to know all this and to do something against

51:58.600 --> 52:05.080
it. We have such a great possibility, biologically, great possibility, to adapt to all those

52:05.960 --> 52:14.600
forms of life we meet. We need to be afraid of bacteria. They make us afraid because they want

52:14.600 --> 52:20.440
to give us injections, money, and you know that all those dangerous infectious diseases,

52:20.440 --> 52:25.560
they all disappeared after the World War II, but only in those countries who lived well,

52:25.560 --> 52:30.520
who had enough to eat, have good departments, and so there were no more infectious diseases.

52:30.520 --> 52:37.160
Suddenly they were going down exponentially, and the vaccines didn't do anything about it.

52:38.040 --> 52:46.360
They were just a very, very small margin of all this. You almost cannot see. So living

52:46.360 --> 52:52.200
well and don't killing each other and eating well and don't taking drugs and all this,

52:52.200 --> 52:56.760
we know, is a good thing, but we don't have to be afraid of microbes.

52:57.640 --> 53:08.760
Although some people die, but much, much less and less, and if people expose themselves,

53:08.760 --> 53:14.840
if you go into a chicken farm where there are 10,000 chickens crammed together and you,

53:14.840 --> 53:19.000
as a human being, go into them and the chicken, they have something, maybe you get ill too,

53:19.000 --> 53:25.240
because that's just a massive contact. Or if you're doing, you have a sexual life,

53:25.240 --> 53:30.360
which is very dangerous, where you make meat people who have a serious disease that is

53:30.360 --> 53:35.080
transmittable, then you may get infected. Okay, but we know all this.

53:36.920 --> 53:39.080
So don't be afraid of,

53:43.080 --> 53:48.200
I'm not, well, I mean, in general, I think you're right, just that, and I'm not a doctor, but like,

53:48.200 --> 53:53.640
I know people who have been very ill, like with regards to like these symptoms

53:53.640 --> 54:00.200
of for a loser. And Mark, you mentioned your wife was also had these kind of issues. So I mean,

54:00.200 --> 54:06.040
there seems to be something, huh? Don't deny that people get ill from that. But you know, this,

54:06.040 --> 54:12.200
this has been before we know, knew that for a user's exist, people got ill too.

54:13.080 --> 54:16.920
I know, but do they have these kinds of symptoms? I don't know. I mean, it's just a question we

54:16.920 --> 54:21.800
would need to research a little bit. Or I mean, maybe you know more about it, but like, it seems to be

54:21.800 --> 54:33.160
like many of us have seen the impacts of perhaps in Germany, there are invasive weeds or trees

54:33.160 --> 54:38.360
that growing that are very, you know, you see them on the highway or near bridges. So clearly,

54:38.360 --> 54:44.200
when new species of plants or organisms are introduced to an area, it takes a while to read

54:44.200 --> 54:50.120
that, you know, to find that new equilibrium. With respect to Lyme disease, this is very well

54:50.120 --> 54:58.280
documented as a book by Chris Newby about this. There were non native forms of syphilis,

54:58.280 --> 55:02.760
physically being injected into ticks, which were also not native to the northeastern part of the

55:02.760 --> 55:10.680
United States. So these are like an invasive species. Okay, it's not native. But eventually,

55:10.680 --> 55:19.720
the environment will, you know, rediscover its equilibrium. Now, oftentimes, a treatment for

55:19.720 --> 55:26.120
Lyme disease is aggressive use of antibiotics, various supplements. And for the most part,

55:26.120 --> 55:34.600
most people can, you know, can, you know, remove these microorganisms from their body.

55:34.600 --> 55:40.360
It's a fair question, though, that perhaps if we had stronger immune systems, as we might have

55:40.360 --> 55:47.960
had 150 years ago, 200 years ago, that the body would be more capable of fighting these off.

55:48.760 --> 55:55.720
So there's so there's many elements to it. It is nonetheless, though, a real issue. I think many

55:55.720 --> 56:01.960
people could avoid it by just, you know, wearing your clothes a certain way when you go out into the

56:01.960 --> 56:08.120
woods. And I think many long term cases of it could be avoided if doctors were allowed to recognize

56:08.680 --> 56:15.720
that it's a real condition and maybe treat it initially, as opposed to saying someone's crazy

56:15.720 --> 56:23.320
for thinking it's a real problem and then letting it go. So, Wolfgang, if I, you bring up an excellent

56:23.320 --> 56:29.240
backstory here that this is actually an opportunity for me to share some of the, like, historical

56:29.240 --> 56:35.000
research that I've done that I'll bring into this. Within the United States, I think worldwide,

56:35.000 --> 56:44.600
in particular, within the United States, the events of World War I and the 1918 flu or the

56:44.600 --> 56:57.960
Spanish flu are oftentimes used as a reason to have any level of health policy response

56:58.520 --> 57:04.680
because it's always said that 50 million or 100 million people could die because of some new

57:05.240 --> 57:12.040
disease, some new bacterium, et cetera. Now, within the United States, there were approximately

57:12.920 --> 57:22.440
500,000 people that died in the year 1918 of what was identified as influenza. The US population

57:22.440 --> 57:27.880
at the time, I think, was about 140 million people. That's a lot of people to die in one year of

57:27.880 --> 57:34.520
influenza. And many of those people were definitely young, oftentimes 30, 35 years old, but almost all

57:34.600 --> 57:44.040
of them, but not maybe some family members as well, were in the military. World War I was a very

57:44.040 --> 57:51.320
unique time for military conflict. There were no helicopters and there were no army tanks in World

57:51.320 --> 58:01.640
War I. World War I involved animals, horses, mules, the United States transported almost one million

58:01.640 --> 58:10.280
animals across the Atlantic Ocean in World War I. In boats that had horrible ventilation conditions,

58:10.280 --> 58:15.880
these animals were malnourished, they were stressed, they were in a high humidity environment,

58:15.880 --> 58:22.200
and oftentimes they themselves were dying of a bacterial pneumonia that were in their lungs.

58:23.480 --> 58:30.520
When you factor in rail transport and boat transport, a high percentage of the US deaths were related

58:30.520 --> 58:37.080
to a really, really aggressive bacterial pneumonia that was highly correlated with US

58:37.080 --> 58:43.880
servicemen and the transport of animals in World War I. Germany and France, to some extent, also

58:43.880 --> 58:52.440
experienced this as well. The moment the war ended, the flu ended. So there was definitely a measurable

58:52.440 --> 58:59.800
tragedy that happened back then. The total number of deaths worldwide were not nearly as high as

58:59.880 --> 59:07.240
projected. In the US newspapers at the end of early 1919, it was stated that two English

59:07.240 --> 59:13.000
servicemen who were in India saw a lot of people, a lot of other troops also struggling with

59:14.280 --> 59:22.280
this pneumonia in 1918 in the port area. So they made a projection that the death rate of all of

59:22.280 --> 59:31.080
India was equal to the US and England. With no evidence other than two accounts based upon a

59:31.080 --> 59:36.200
port, which was also subject to the same conditions that we were seeing in the United States.

59:37.320 --> 59:46.440
And very quickly, potentially 1.5 million or 2 million deaths from this pneumonia were rounded

59:46.440 --> 59:53.560
up to being, well, it was probably 12 million worldwide. And then by 1950, well, it was probably

59:53.560 --> 01:00:03.400
20 million. The current encyclopedias will say it's probably 50 to 100 million. Now, the tragedy

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:11.080
was real. It definitely impacted this population of people, but it has been completely mischaracterized

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:20.040
and overhyped to justify this, oh my goodness, any day, something could happen with a vaccine

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:25.880
or a Native American tribe or something and it can spread around the world. And only doctors can

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.760
save you, only the scientists. That's it. It's an end times prophecy, if you will. And it's a

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:40.840
ticket to do whatever, whenever. And I'm not saying that it was a hoax, but what I'm saying is that

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:47.880
it was a real tragedy that has been completely mischaracterized and rewritten. And very few

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:57.160
people are willing to to dig into this. All of this is documented. If you look at 1916, 1917

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.360
newspaper articles, it was generally, there was this thing called the shipping flu. Whereas many

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.240
is 25 to 30% of all animals that went on to a boat were dead by the time they got off of it

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:19.640
because of the conditions that these animals were made to reside while in transport. This is

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:26.520
being erased. And I think it's really important. I'm not saying to dig into history because you

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:33.880
want to win a trivia game. I think it's really important for our own rights and so that we know

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:41.080
how to properly view the direction of all the science is going to revisit and to properly

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:47.880
capture this information in this history. Because it's being erased. And I think, well, as we can see,

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:56.600
horrible things are happening because of what the erasure of this history is enabling. So I'm

01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:09.800
glad you brought that up, Dr. Mark, do you have a giant amount of topics that we could cover with

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:16.840
you? And I find it very inspiring and very interesting. Would you say, is this, have we covered these

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.320
two topics? I would maybe like to re invite you at some other time to maybe talk about some

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:29.320
additional topic. Is there anything that you would like to share with us now in addition?

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:40.440
Well, I again, thank you so much. I agree with what the doctor said. You have to look at overall

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:50.200
health. It's I have a lot of days where I get very angry and crabby and frustrated. But it's

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:58.760
important to stay optimistic, harboring too much anger or bitterness is also not good for our health.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:04.760
Although it does give it a little energy sometimes. It's not good for our health. I will say that

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.960
and watch Jonathan Kui's last show. I think he did a great job covering this.

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:16.200
In spite of what you've heard, aside from the people who are getting old and gray like me,

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:22.920
you, people are still the world's most valuable asset.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:34.360
Not of course, it's because of the love that we bring and what we represent. But even from a

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:42.120
scientific standpoint, there has been this, this greed that started, I think this, this is a little

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:49.400
dark in World War two with a very large captive population of people that could have been used

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:56.200
for a variety of medical experiments. There has been this increasing greed and desire to find

01:03:56.200 --> 01:04:01.720
ways to get more and more people effectively to be a captured audience without them knowing it.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:12.040
To help advance a very, very heavily funded genomics agenda. And it has often been said

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.640
that, oh, there's just a plan to kill all the people on the planet, depopulation and so on.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:27.800
Well, I'm not saying that we are adored and wanted. The unfortunate reality is that this agenda,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.600
this genomics agenda, which potentially is about beating cancer and life extension,

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:40.600
cannot advance without people. It cannot advance without people. They were hoping at some point

01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:46.840
that they could just solve everything with computers. No, you need people, you need data to collect

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:53.720
in order to make it even possible, maybe someday to work. And I think that there is a desire to

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:59.400
get us to think that somehow we're just all useless eaters and garbage. I'm not saying we're loved,

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:07.320
but imagine if the population of the world realized, oh, my goodness, our bodies and our sovereignty

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:13.240
are actually the most valuable resource on the planet. That really changes, I think, the dialogue

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:25.240
into a way, which perhaps we can have properly discuss. If people want to accept medical risks

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:32.280
to advance science, they can do it and they should receive proper compensation for this.

01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:41.400
So stay healthy, try to focus on the positives. We're going to get through this. It may take

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:49.960
a long time to expose all of this. But what we all have and what our children have is,

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:57.240
I still think the most valuable resource. And I think there's a great attempt out to get people

01:05:58.120 --> 01:06:06.360
to not talk about these things. And also to try to focus on the don't get baited,

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:13.160
don't get tricked into having the wrong arguments. There's a desire to get all of us to focus

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:22.120
completely on the existence of a particular molecule and what it can do. And it's impossible

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:32.360
to discount that. But if we just look at the bigger picture, I would state almost all of the

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:42.200
lives which were lost, could have been saved. If we weren't looking for it, this thing. So why

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:47.480
shouldn't that be the kickoff of all the conversations? So again, there's a lot of other things,

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.320
intellectual property law, it sounds boring. It's very relevant. We can get into all of that.

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.480
And another one, I would love to do that. I'm sorry, it didn't have slides for you.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:06.120
I have a ton of content organized and so on. But consider this to be a representation of the fact

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:14.040
that I have this life, which has also been impacted by these events. So thank you for this.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.040
Thank you very much for all the information you gave us and all the views you gave us.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:29.480
And I think if I should sum it up, what you said, I have the idea to say just don't get lost in

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:39.640
molecules. Don't get lost in molecules. Mankind has not known much about molecules in genetics

01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:46.520
before. It's very recent. And the world has not become better with genetic knowledge.

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:52.600
There has been a new way of discriminating people with their genes. Before they were

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:58.360
discriminated because of the skin color of their sex and all this. But now you can discriminate

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:03.960
people because of their genes. You can treat those with those genes different from those with

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:12.920
other genes. And those ones who can analyze these genes, they can just characterize and they can

01:08:12.920 --> 01:08:20.520
just find the groups they want to discriminate. So if you have tests and if you have possibilities

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:26.040
of biological analysis of human being, distinguish one from the other, you can discriminate them.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:33.800
And in all human rights, in all charters we have, there's always a charter against discrimination.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:40.280
All different, we are all different human beings. But we are all have different or have equal

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:49.160
rights. And this is in every, in every law all over the world. This is the main thing that we are

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:55.960
human beings with our dignity. But we are all different. We have different diseases. We have

01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.040
different ideas. We have, but we have to respect each other playing the same game after the same

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:09.080
rules, like in football, no fouls. We all have the same, we all are different, but we have the

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:16.280
same rights. And this is if you if you start distracting people into molecules and particles,

01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:22.200
only some people understand those some people want to influence the rest of the world with their

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:29.000
knowledge. They narrative about their molecules, their view of the world. And they want to tell us

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.800
this is important. You have to be careful from the molecules. I know you don't know them. Yes.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:41.000
And this is a they make business with it. And it's not important. There are more important things.

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:47.000
But Mark, what I also draw from the conversation with you is, you know, I mean, one thing is,

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.440
of course, that we are not ants. I mean, it's really very important. Each, each one of us is

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:57.160
very important. And each one of us can make the difference, you know, can, can be the tipping

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:04.200
points, basically, of waking up someone else or like inspiring someone else or themselves,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:11.400
you know, do something that's going to be, you know, that's going to tear apart or away the green

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:18.040
curtain, you know, from the end. And we can then see the little dwarf behind it. But and I think

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:24.520
it's also, you know, one thing is so important. I think that is that we try to find the truth,

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:30.520
or like, at least we do not have any taboos in mind, like, you know, corners that we cannot touch

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:36.520
and that we really have to shine light in, in, in, in every corner. I mean, as you mentioned,

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:42.280
the, the opioid crisis, the, the Lyme disease and so on. I mean, there cannot be any taboos.

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.640
And I think we, I mean, it's true. Wolfgang says that we cannot be focusing on just the

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
topics or the, the train of thought that's been presenting to us, you know,

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:59.800
been presented to us. But I think it's also really important for us to have no barriers of thinking

01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.160
and, and look at all the corners. And I think if we then throw together all everything that we

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:09.800
find out, and even if some people look at the molecules and say, Oh, there's no molecule,

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.440
or there's, there's this or that, that doesn't make any sense, you know, and even because there

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:20.280
need to be like people who really question in detail, because otherwise you have no basis for

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:25.240
maybe questioning or like the statistics and so on. But then I think it's, it's really, we,

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:32.120
we just have to look in every corner to, to, to find the truth or what we can at that point,

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:38.040
consider to be the state of knowledge, you know, and question, we have to constantly continue

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:43.000
questioning what's going on. And I think this is the time, because now so many people have

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.400
really like an, on a large scale, started to question everything. And yet they have not gone

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.040
crazy, all of them. And you know, it's, it's, there's, there's, I think there's even a better

01:11:54.040 --> 01:12:01.720
life. I mean, although it's hard, but it's a better life to, to be not like blinded by whatever the

01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:06.120
media and the narrative and so on. But really look behind the curtains. And I think we have to

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:10.280
continue doing that. And Mark, I'm looking forward to continuing the conversation with you.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:14.440
Thank you so much. Me as well. I appreciate the opportunity.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:18.040
Thanks so much. Thank you. Bye.
