Hello, hello, hello. It's 10.07 a.m. recording time Eastern Standard Time Tuesday, March

00:08.660 --> 00:17.480
12th year 2024. He's tonic.live, Mark Coolack. And today we have a very special guest. Her

00:17.480 --> 00:24.940
name is Leslie Bats. I've met her several months ago in person. And we had some wonderful

00:24.940 --> 00:29.280
conversation about some of the experience that she has been through and the work that

00:29.280 --> 00:35.140
she is doing right now. But I think I would prefer my and to hear to for her to be able

00:35.140 --> 00:41.880
to share in her own words her introduction and to introduce us to her story.

00:41.880 --> 00:48.440
So welcome, welcome, Leslie Bats. And I met Leslie Bats through a mutual friend, Marie

00:48.440 --> 00:55.000
Clark, who I've interviewed at least twice on this show from New Hampshire. And if those

00:55.000 --> 01:03.560
of you are familiar with the story of Marie, you know that she had a very serious situation

01:03.560 --> 01:11.640
where she was diagnosed with with COVID. And she was in the hospital. And she was concerned

01:11.640 --> 01:17.680
about the medical procedures that were there about to start with her some of the medications.

01:17.680 --> 01:22.440
And she did not have an advocate. And this was from a story back in 2021, I believe.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.480
And of course, the reason why she shared her story was to encourage people to have an

01:25.480 --> 01:30.520
advocate before they go into emergency care. Don't do it alone. And the people that she's

01:30.520 --> 01:36.600
met afterwards and organized with, if you will, or collaborated with along that journey included

01:36.600 --> 01:43.720
Leslie. And that's how Leslie came to my attention. So Leslie, welcome to the show.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.160
Thank you, sir. Good morning. Good morning. We've only met in person once before. I think

01:48.160 --> 01:56.920
was at the Children's Health Defense Conference in late 2023. And there you shared the story

01:56.920 --> 02:04.440
with me, your husband. And yes, I think there's two things we'd like to capture today is,

02:04.440 --> 02:09.800
is that story as well? Of course, any messages that you would have for other people so that

02:09.800 --> 02:16.520
to to help avoid a similar thing or what to do going forward. And I would also hope during

02:16.520 --> 02:21.560
the show to talk about some of the activity that you have participated within in, I believe,

02:21.560 --> 02:28.400
a state of Oklahoma. So so so please, can you introduce yourself to the audience?

02:28.400 --> 02:38.840
Well, up until October of 2021, I was just a stay at home mom. I had a very normal life,

02:38.840 --> 02:48.720
husband, son, little farm rural Oklahoma. I had what I thought was, for me, a perfect life.

02:48.720 --> 02:56.720
And that month of that year, my husband went out of town for work and he came home and

02:56.720 --> 03:06.280
began showing symptoms. We thought it was the flu. His co-worker, the next morning tested positive

03:06.280 --> 03:13.160
for COVID. We stayed at home and treated at home with what we thought were all of the right

03:13.160 --> 03:21.280
things. Ivermectin, azithromycin, vitamins, but I don't think at that time, we were using high

03:21.280 --> 03:28.400
enough dosages. I think it was a little too late and a little too little when we got started.

03:28.400 --> 03:34.160
So on the 9th of October, I had ended up having to take him to the emergency room because I wasn't

03:34.200 --> 03:41.480
able to find him any at home oxygen. The biggest mistake that I made was putting a pulse oximeter

03:41.480 --> 03:48.560
on his finger. I had taken care of my mother in respiratory failure for three years. So I was

03:48.560 --> 03:54.680
kind of familiar with oxygen saturations and the level where you start running into the danger

03:54.680 --> 04:02.920
zone when oxygen starts getting a little low and he dropped down into the 70s. So I knew at that

04:02.920 --> 04:09.280
point, he needed to be on oxygen. There was just no question about it. Because we were so rural,

04:09.280 --> 04:16.600
we didn't have a whole lot of options for treatment. All we had was the emergency room. So I took him

04:16.600 --> 04:21.720
to the emergency room and cushing. And he was actually doing really well. They put him on 10

04:21.720 --> 04:29.920
liters of oxygen. He was saturating well, no labored breathing. He wasn't cyanotic. He, you know,

04:29.920 --> 04:40.920
there were no symptoms as far as distress. Anything else says fever. He really didn't. He had a fever

04:40.920 --> 04:47.000
the previous week. At the time he reached the emergency room, it was low grade, maybe 99. And

04:47.000 --> 04:53.040
after they put him on the oxygen at 10 liters and a breathing treatment, he was doing great. So when

04:53.040 --> 04:58.200
I got the phone call two hours later, because they wouldn't allow me to go in because he was exposed

04:58.200 --> 05:03.160
for, you know, I was exposed and he was positive. But as he got out of the car, the last words he

05:03.160 --> 05:08.520
said to me, or do not let them put me on event. And I said, Okay, maybe you got it. I didn't expect

05:08.520 --> 05:14.880
him to be staying. I expected them to send him home after, you know, the breathing treatment and

05:14.880 --> 05:22.760
maybe send him home with some oxygen. They chose to admit him. And they transferred him from cushing

05:22.760 --> 05:33.560
Oklahoma to Tulsa, Oklahoma, to the ICU. With your knowledge? They told me they didn't ask me. They

05:33.560 --> 05:39.080
just simply said, we're transferring him. I couldn't understand why I kept asking them, is he in

05:39.080 --> 05:46.200
distress? Well, no, but just in case he decompensates, we want him to be in a higher level of care. Were

05:46.200 --> 05:50.840
you back at home now? Because you're staying at home mom? Or were you at the hospital at this point?

05:52.200 --> 05:57.560
It's now 10 30 at night. And my son and I are sitting in the car in the parking lot at the

05:57.560 --> 06:04.440
emergency room waiting for him to come out. So I said, Well, how are you treating? How's he getting

06:04.440 --> 06:12.360
to Tulsa? They said, well, he's going by ambulance. I said, Okay, I'm assuming regular standard ambulance.

06:13.160 --> 06:17.160
I said, Well, great. I'll run back to the house and I can meet the ambulance on the way there to give

06:17.160 --> 06:23.000
him his charger and everything because I have to get my home my son home to bed. And I'll just come

06:23.000 --> 06:30.840
see him in the morning. She says, you can't go into the ICU in Tulsa. She says, it's a closed ward

06:30.840 --> 06:35.640
because it's COVID. It's isolation. I said, Well, then I definitely need to get this to him now.

06:36.600 --> 06:42.520
On the way, she says, but we're here fighting him. We're sending him by lifelight. I said,

06:42.520 --> 06:48.440
Why are you sending him by lifelight if he's stable? And her response was, well, in case he

06:48.440 --> 06:53.400
decompensates, we don't we can't intubate him in the ambulance. I said, you're not going to

06:53.400 --> 06:59.480
intubate him. He's already told you and I've told you, you witnessed him telling me don't let

06:59.480 --> 07:06.440
them put me on a vent. So it didn't really make any sense. But he apparently agreed to it.

07:07.720 --> 07:15.640
And their work. Yes, in their words. He didn't question it. And he wouldn't because he wasn't

07:16.520 --> 07:22.440
really that knowledgeable when it came to medical care. I kind of was the one who made the decisions

07:22.520 --> 07:33.880
and and again, they never asked me. They just told me. At that point, I contacted the ICU,

07:34.600 --> 07:39.400
spoke with the nurse there as he was getting off of the hell. It took 10 minutes to get him there

07:39.400 --> 07:45.800
as he was getting off of the helicopter. And I told them, place a D and I do not intubate

07:45.800 --> 07:53.720
order on his chart immediately. They agreed. We texted back and forth. He and I, he got settled.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.280
And I said, okay, well, he's stable. Everything's fine. They're just keeping him for observation,

08:00.280 --> 08:07.000
I guess, and I went to bed woke up the next morning. He was doing very well. But what I found out was

08:07.000 --> 08:13.400
they had increased his oxygen. He was in the emergency room on 10 liters of oxygen. He was

08:13.400 --> 08:19.800
transported on 10 liters of oxygen. But the moment he was admitted, they increased it to 60 liters.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.360
No, I don't know if you're very familiar with oxygen toxicity.

08:25.960 --> 08:31.720
But the symptoms of oxygen toxicity are shortness of breath, rapid respiration rate,

08:32.280 --> 08:39.000
and coughing, which are all symptoms supposedly of COVID as well. On the tank, he was doing very

08:39.000 --> 08:44.520
well. Everything was going fine. He's sitting up. We're video calling each other. Everything looks

08:44.520 --> 08:52.040
great. At 4.20 in the morning on the 11th, they started sedating him without telling you they're

08:52.040 --> 08:59.560
one of us. And the sedative that they were using, the prosthetics apparently was causing chest pain

08:59.560 --> 09:05.240
because of something called a basis phasm. So they started administering morphine on top of it

09:06.040 --> 09:16.040
to cover the pain. They started at a very low dose of sedative. I spoke with him that morning by

09:16.040 --> 09:22.760
text because he now had a bypass on because he was short of breath and had a rapid respiration.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.680
And they continued the 60 liters of oxygen even on the bypass mask.

09:26.840 --> 09:35.800
The last text message I received from him on the 11th was they won't stop asking me about

09:35.800 --> 09:40.440
intubation and I'm starting to lose my cool. At that point,

09:43.320 --> 09:50.760
apparently he had refused to sign all of the consent forms for intubation and the arterial

09:50.760 --> 09:57.320
catheter, central line placement, all of the procedures he refused to sign any consent forms

09:57.320 --> 10:05.160
for it. They started increasing the sedative until they literally isolated him and I.

10:05.720 --> 10:10.680
He didn't know he was being sedated because his IV pump was outside of his room and around the

10:10.680 --> 10:16.520
quarter of the wall. He couldn't see what it was being administered. They did not tell me

10:16.520 --> 10:21.320
that they were sedating him. As I'm trying to reach him, I'm calling the nurses and said he's

10:21.320 --> 10:27.640
not answering his phone. What is going on? And I'm being told, well, he's watching TV and he's

10:27.640 --> 10:31.800
evening dinner. He's just he's refusing to speak with you. He doesn't want to talk to you anymore.

10:33.560 --> 10:39.240
I said, I'm coming to the hospital. You can't come married a long time.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.520
You know somebody you know that that's not something that he would do.

10:45.480 --> 10:51.640
No, because the the text message immediately prior to they won't stop asking me about

10:51.640 --> 10:55.160
intubation was, I love you, babe. And I told him, I said, I love you too.

10:58.200 --> 11:02.120
So there wasn't any reason why he would refuse to speak to me. So I told them I was coming to the

11:02.120 --> 11:06.680
hospital. They said, you can't come here. You'll be arrested. So at that point, I have to make

11:06.680 --> 11:11.720
a choice between taking care of my child because we had no family. I did in Oklahoma. I had no

11:11.800 --> 11:16.920
one there that could watch my son before me while I went to the hospital. And I was sick too. My

11:16.920 --> 11:25.080
son and I were both very sick at this point. So I was kind of had my hands tied. There wasn't a

11:25.080 --> 11:29.640
whole lot I could do. I started calling the administration for the hospital. I started calling

11:29.640 --> 11:34.520
the patient advocate. I was screaming and yelling at everybody. I could get to answer the phone

11:34.520 --> 11:39.960
saying they're supposed to be a do not order or do not intubate order on the chart. Why are they

11:40.040 --> 11:45.480
harassing him about intubation? All you're going to do is make him angry and he'll get up and he'll

11:45.480 --> 11:54.840
walk out. And I couldn't get any response from anyone. So I continued trying to reach him and

11:54.840 --> 12:05.240
the nurses throughout the night. By noon, actually, I believe it was 1240 something on the 12th,

12:05.240 --> 12:11.240
I receive a phone call from the doctor telling me that my husband's given consent to intubation.

12:13.160 --> 12:19.160
Let me take a step back. On the 11th, the very first contact I had from that doctor was a phone

12:19.160 --> 12:24.680
call from him and when I answered the phone, he said, is this Ms. Bats? I said, yes. And he said,

12:25.320 --> 12:29.000
I hope you're vaccinated because your husband's getting ready to go on a ventilator for a month

12:29.000 --> 12:34.680
and then he's going to be in rehab for a year if he survives. And somebody needs to be alive to

12:34.680 --> 12:40.840
take care of him. I said, he's not going to go on a ventilator for a, there's a D and I order

12:40.840 --> 12:48.760
on the chart. And my medical status is between myself and my doctor. He said, yeah, but if you're

12:48.760 --> 12:56.680
vaccinated, you won't get sick. I said, that's not true. So the doctor was suggesting that his

12:56.760 --> 13:03.320
illness might have been because of his medical status. He was unvaccinated.

13:07.000 --> 13:15.960
And interestingly, what I found out later was this particular doctor has a YouTube video

13:17.320 --> 13:24.840
that he has put out in that YouTube video. Now, the video was August of 2021. My husband was

13:24.840 --> 13:32.680
admitted in October of 2021. And this video talks about how all of this misinformation about

13:32.680 --> 13:39.160
the vaccine, you got to go get it. It's safe. It's effective. Don't listen to the lies. If you

13:39.160 --> 13:44.200
come into my ICU and you're unvaccinated, you're in big trouble. Because if I have to put you on a

13:44.200 --> 13:49.320
ventilator, you're not going to survive. We haven't had anybody survive for months.

13:49.320 --> 13:57.000
And he personally told me that they'd only ever had two people ever come off of it in his unit.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.040
Only two people ever survived a ventilator.

14:01.400 --> 14:07.000
So one would think that that should be in and of itself reason to not use it.

14:07.880 --> 14:12.840
The next question could be, of course, it's hard to know the right questions to ask in this

14:12.840 --> 14:16.360
situation. But what's the survival rate if you don't use event?

14:16.360 --> 14:24.200
They don't know because everybody went on the vent. And I told him, that was when it got a little

14:24.200 --> 14:27.800
unpleasant. And I told him, I said, well, then you're not very good at your job. Are you?

14:28.600 --> 14:35.000
I fired him. But he told me at that point that he I couldn't fire him because he was the only

14:35.000 --> 14:39.320
critical care doctor that could take care of my hospital. I said, you're the only doctor in that

14:39.400 --> 14:42.680
hospital that can treat my husband. And he said, yes.

14:45.560 --> 14:52.760
So he and I fought the entire duration of my husband's hospital stay. I fired him multiple times.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.880
It wasn't a good relationship with the doctor at all.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.720
So at this point on the 12th, he calls me and he tells me that my husband has given consent to

15:03.720 --> 15:07.240
the intubation and I called him a liar. Said, I don't believe you.

15:09.960 --> 15:15.960
I want to hear this from him. I haven't spoken to my husband in over 24 hours. I've had no contact

15:15.960 --> 15:22.920
with him. He is going to tell me this himself. I immediately call his phone on video.

15:24.600 --> 15:29.640
And someone picks the video up. I cannot see my husband's hands. I think at this point he's

15:29.640 --> 15:35.160
being restrained physically as well as chemically. He seems disoriented.

15:37.160 --> 15:44.920
Just he's speaking something, but I can't understand him because a BIPAP mask covers everything.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.640
So I can't understand what he's saying. And the video called last 31 seconds and then we're

15:51.640 --> 15:58.520
disconnected. The doctor immediately calls me back. Again, trying to get my consent. I said,

15:58.520 --> 16:03.240
you've said he's consented. If he has given consent, you don't need my consent. There will

16:03.240 --> 16:11.080
be a signed consent form on the chart. I've seen my husband clearly. Again, I don't know he's being

16:11.080 --> 16:18.280
sedated at this point or that he's been under any medication. So I'm assuming there's no reason

16:18.360 --> 16:21.560
he can't sign a form if that's what his wishes are.

16:25.080 --> 16:33.320
They hang up with me and two minutes after our call and they administer a paralytic to put my

16:33.320 --> 16:41.480
husband into respiratory arrest. At the time that we were on the phone, the doctor and I,

16:42.440 --> 16:50.520
my husband's oxygen saturation was at a 91%. There is no clinical reason to intubate someone

16:50.520 --> 17:02.520
at a 91% oxygen saturation. He goes on the ventilator and they're giving me the very

17:02.520 --> 17:08.120
standard updates for the 12th and the 13th. And then on the 14th, because I'm still

17:08.760 --> 17:13.240
trying to get my husband moved out of this hospital, trying to get him transferred somewhere else,

17:13.240 --> 17:16.760
trying to get anything done, the

17:20.440 --> 17:26.280
the doctor calls me and says, would you like to come visit him now? And it was a slap in the face.

17:27.720 --> 17:32.600
I was going to be arrested if I tried to come help my husband before he went on a ventilator.

17:32.600 --> 17:37.960
But now that he's on a ventilator, it's okay for me to come in and to visit him. They knew

17:37.960 --> 17:40.920
I was still sick. And that was okay.

17:44.040 --> 17:49.400
So I'm able to come to the hospital now and see my husband. When I get there, there are

17:51.240 --> 17:58.520
a tremendous amount of injuries on his face and upper body. His nose has been cut open

17:59.160 --> 18:06.280
and the skin's kind of kind of flayed for lack of a better term. He's bruised

18:07.960 --> 18:13.000
he looks like he's been in a bar fight. And I asked him about these injuries and

18:14.920 --> 18:21.080
they told me that intubation was a violent procedure. I said, no, it's not. My mother in

18:21.080 --> 18:26.760
respiratory failure, she had been on a ventilator probably a dozen times and I never saw her look

18:26.760 --> 18:35.080
like this. And they said, well, it's a metal blade and it curves and it can be a violent procedure.

18:37.960 --> 18:43.160
So they never explained any of these injuries. They never documented anything but the nose wound

18:43.160 --> 18:49.720
in his records or what happened leading up to any of this. As a matter of fact, the doctor never

18:49.720 --> 18:54.840
documented any reason for intubating him. It just simply said, patient is now intubated. He never

18:54.840 --> 19:00.760
said why, never said that, you know, he was in acute distress, never mentioned anything about

19:00.760 --> 19:05.800
the conversation. My husband giving consent never mentions the conversation with me refusing to

19:05.800 --> 19:17.000
give consent. None of that is document. At that point, I visited him on the 14th and on the 15th.

19:18.680 --> 19:23.560
I'm not able to come see him on the 16th because there's no one to watch my son that day. He saw

19:23.560 --> 19:33.960
him from school. His lasted, his symptoms were, they came and went very quickly actually because we

19:33.960 --> 19:38.280
caught him in time to get him started on the medications and he was all better, no fever,

19:38.280 --> 19:47.080
going back to school. On the 16th, based on what I've been able to find in the medical records,

19:48.440 --> 19:51.960
my husband woke up and he extubated, he pulled the tube out.

19:55.400 --> 20:02.520
They reparrelized him because they were starting to lighten his sedation because they figured,

20:02.520 --> 20:09.240
you know, he's calm, he's not fighting anything. Well, somebody wasn't paying attention and he woke

20:09.240 --> 20:20.840
up. They re-intubated him and the doctor ordered a sedation goal of a RAS negative five. Now,

20:20.840 --> 20:25.640
the way I understand it, based on people I've spoken with, a negative five should never be a

20:25.640 --> 20:32.760
sedation goal. It's like the warning sign. It's the danger zone. If you evaluate a patient

20:32.760 --> 20:38.760
and they're at a negative five, you should actually reverse what you're doing, decrease the medications

20:38.760 --> 20:43.080
and that's something to stay away from, not something to shoot for or make a goal.

20:43.080 --> 20:49.800
So if I may, a negative five means more sedated and closer to being sedated to the point of

20:50.600 --> 20:57.400
passing out. Over to. Yeah, thanks. It's actually based on brain activity.

20:58.600 --> 21:05.880
They break this chart up and yes, the negative five is between 20 and 30. A negative four, I believe,

21:05.880 --> 21:17.400
is between 40, 30 and 40. A negative three is between 30 and 50. So it kind of,

21:18.360 --> 21:24.920
for the brain activity, that's, they have a monitor on them to monitor their brain activity.

21:24.920 --> 21:32.600
So it's a negative five, which as you say is, should not be a goal. It's a sign that it's as far as you

21:32.600 --> 21:40.360
should go and definitely try to be tailoring back or winding it back. Okay. Absolutely.

21:41.240 --> 21:47.240
Um, so at this point, he orders the sedation goal of arrest negative five. They

21:48.600 --> 21:54.440
increase all of the medications, the fentanyl, medazoleum, propofol, nimbec,

21:54.440 --> 22:02.840
presidex, and one other. I don't know. It was, there was another one for, I'll look at right

22:02.840 --> 22:11.080
up my head. One thing that's not included is noteworthy. And it is a noteworthy part of the

22:11.080 --> 22:18.040
story. It was, was not any of the giliadromdesivir, which is often times, and I made this mistake

22:18.040 --> 22:25.960
thinking that it was a, it was always a part of this procedure. But in your case, it was not to

22:25.960 --> 22:31.560
the best year knowledge. And you've, you've attained the records, which is a lot of people

22:31.560 --> 22:37.400
don't even try to, but you have those records and you sent me excerpts of them. So you've gone

22:37.400 --> 22:47.720
through this line by line, minute by minute. Yes. Well, that was, that was the thing. The only

22:47.720 --> 22:52.040
reason I got the medical records was because I was looking for that consent form. I just

22:52.040 --> 22:57.080
wanted to see the consent form to see that it was signed based on my conversation with the doctor

22:57.160 --> 23:06.920
and what I knew about my husband. I didn't believe him. And in my worldview, I always thought

23:08.120 --> 23:15.160
informed consent was required. It was required by law. It's, it's your basic right to have informed

23:15.160 --> 23:19.080
consent for any procedure, any treatment. And if you didn't have that, that was a crime

23:19.880 --> 23:28.040
because it was battery. So what I found after I got the medical records was all of the rest of

23:28.040 --> 23:33.800
this. I had no idea when he was in the hospital, any of this had even happened. They never told me

23:33.800 --> 23:42.760
he woke up on the 16th. They never told me he was being sedated. They never told me that after this

23:42.760 --> 23:48.760
event, where they start with the fentanyl, the medazzle, and the propofolvent index, they maxed out

23:48.760 --> 23:56.920
all of those medications. They actually exceeded the hospital's dosing limits. For fentanyl,

23:56.920 --> 24:01.640
the hospital's dosing limit is supposed to be 200 micrograms per kilogram an hour.

24:03.000 --> 24:13.640
He was on 250. The pharmacy actually removed all of the dosing instructions from the labels.

24:13.720 --> 24:20.360
The doctor ordered these drugs. It would be like going to the drugstore and then handing you a

24:20.360 --> 24:25.560
bottle of oxycontin with a blank label on it with no dosing instructions, just saying here you go,

24:25.560 --> 24:32.520
take it however you want, or give it however you want. So the pharmacy released these medications

24:32.520 --> 24:40.600
with no dosing instructions, no limits, no parameters, nothing. And they overrode that section

24:41.400 --> 24:51.720
in order to be able to do this. And within a few hours, his brain activity level reaches zero.

24:51.720 --> 24:56.120
So they've effectively overdosed my husband to the point where they shut his brain off.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.680
He did regain brain activity, but from that point forward, it was so erratic.

25:05.640 --> 25:13.640
And I'm not a doctor. I really need someone who has knowledge in this to help me go through these

25:13.640 --> 25:22.440
things, but it appears based on the fact that he goes from a three to a 75 to a 40, like minute to

25:22.440 --> 25:32.600
minute. It's either akin to seizure activity or a brain injury that his brain is literally just

25:32.600 --> 25:41.560
kind of misfiring, because it doesn't make any sense. From the prior to the over prior to this

25:41.560 --> 25:49.000
incident, it's pretty, you know, it's a pretty slow wave as things rise, you know, brain activity

25:49.000 --> 25:58.920
rises and falls. This is straight up and down. You know, his activity is it's really unusual

25:59.880 --> 26:08.520
and very erratic. So I'm trying to find perhaps a neurologist somebody that can

26:09.160 --> 26:13.720
interpret the information for me so that I can understand exactly what it means.

26:15.480 --> 26:20.600
For people who are watching this, if you are or you know someone who could volunteer their time,

26:21.320 --> 26:24.360
reach out to me and I will pass that information on to Leslie.

26:25.240 --> 26:30.440
Thank you. And obviously, you never wanted to be in this situation. But here we are.

26:31.640 --> 26:38.360
And I know you're trying to help others. And I think highlighting the fact that

26:40.920 --> 26:48.120
you trusted the system. I mean, no one. Yes. But you were not overly skeptical. You assumed

26:48.760 --> 26:54.920
the best decisions would be made. And like most people, you weren't aware of what could have been

26:54.920 --> 27:01.080
happening. And that put you at a disadvantage as a caretaker, as most people would be.

27:01.960 --> 27:07.720
And I'm sure there's many people who afterwards still did not collect the records because they

27:07.720 --> 27:13.080
still they, well, you're dealing with the grief, the tragedy, how do you move on and so on. And

27:14.040 --> 27:19.560
recollecting that I think is important to help other people open up to perhaps something that

27:19.560 --> 27:25.320
may have happened to them or someone that they know. And that's exactly it. Again,

27:26.280 --> 27:30.600
I never would have questioned anything. It didn't seem right. But

27:32.280 --> 27:38.040
at the same time, you have to understand at that time period, we're all being the fear porn was

27:38.120 --> 27:44.760
insane. Oh, yes. And the doctors were short handed at the hospitals, and they're short staffed. And

27:44.760 --> 27:49.160
you know, all of these terrible things are going on. And COVID is so bad, you can't go,

27:49.160 --> 27:55.160
even though my husband and I have been sleeping in the same bed, I can't now go see him in the hospital

27:56.040 --> 28:06.520
because he has COVID makes no sense. But so you, you, your conditioned myself, my mother was a nurse.

28:06.520 --> 28:13.560
She was an emergency room nurse. I was conditioned my whole life to believe doctors are the good guys.

28:14.760 --> 28:19.320
These are the ones that that you can trust. These are the ones that no matter what,

28:20.520 --> 28:25.400
they're going to take care of you. And it's funny because we can believe that

28:26.200 --> 28:33.000
police officers can do bad things. We can believe that teachers can do bad things. We can believe that

28:33.960 --> 28:42.760
that creatures can do bad things. But for some reason, it is ingrained in us that doctors are

28:42.760 --> 28:48.440
infallible. You know, maybe they make mistakes every now and then, but they're not bad people.

28:48.440 --> 28:53.640
They all want to do this because they all want to help. They all want to fix you. They all want to

28:53.640 --> 29:01.400
take care of you. They do this because they love the idea of helping people. That was what I was

29:01.480 --> 29:08.120
conditioned to believe. And this was a completely different time.

29:09.720 --> 29:16.920
It is was right after they had rolled out the vaccine mandates for health care workers and so

29:17.560 --> 29:24.440
in the military. And so what they did effectively was remove everyone from the hospital system

29:24.520 --> 29:33.800
that would sympathize with an unvaccinated patient. Everyone that was left was under the

29:33.800 --> 29:39.800
impression had had drunk the Kool-Aid. If you don't take this vaccine, you want to kill your

29:39.800 --> 29:47.880
grandmother. We all saw Jimmy Kimmel and his vaccinated patients don't even deserve a hospital

29:47.880 --> 29:54.120
bed kind of thing. This was the mentality. You weren't human. You were less than human

29:54.120 --> 29:58.360
if you didn't follow along and get vaccinated. You didn't care about your fellow man.

29:59.800 --> 30:05.240
So this idea permeated the entire health care system.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.400
And what I also found was with the exception of the doctor that treated my husband,

30:11.960 --> 30:19.960
most of the nursing staff had been licensed to nurse within the time of COVID since 2020.

30:19.960 --> 30:31.640
And it's interesting because it appears that they moved the nurses that they thought would have a

30:31.640 --> 30:37.880
heart for lack of a better term out of the COVID works. And they put the new nurses in that had

30:37.880 --> 30:47.320
no frame of reference of what health care would have been prior to COVID. And they got on the job

30:47.320 --> 30:52.600
training in a system that was already in crisis.

30:55.640 --> 30:57.480
When I've been working with some of these other

30:58.280 --> 31:06.680
widows and people who have lost family members, the stories are so similar between what happened

31:06.680 --> 31:11.480
with my husband, what happened with their husband. There's always the over oxygenation on admission.

31:11.480 --> 31:20.920
The minute that they're admitted, they're always increased the oxygen supply. They almost always

31:20.920 --> 31:26.680
are being sedated at very least 24 hours prior to the time of intubation.

31:27.320 --> 31:35.560
Now, pracidex is actually a sedative design specifically for intubation. That's its purpose.

31:35.560 --> 31:40.120
It's not intended to be used for more than 24 hours because it can cause side effects.

31:40.200 --> 31:47.640
Bradycardia, tachycardia, hypertension, hypotension, transient, cardiac events.

31:47.640 --> 31:52.840
Just there's a tremendous number of side effects that come along with this particular drought.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.200
So it's supposed to be designed specifically for use in an intubation.

31:58.440 --> 32:09.560
They're determining, like I said, 24 hours ahead of time when they're going to

32:09.560 --> 32:14.440
intubate these patients because they're already sedating them for it.

32:15.320 --> 32:18.920
There are plenty of medications they can use for anxiety.

32:20.760 --> 32:24.760
But none of these patients are actually being documented as having anxiety.

32:25.000 --> 32:31.560
They're just all of a sudden they're delirious for no reason whatsoever.

32:31.560 --> 32:35.560
It comes out of nowhere. And that delirium's not even documented.

32:35.560 --> 32:43.320
They just start sedating them. Supposedly. That's the story that you're given is that

32:43.320 --> 32:50.600
well, they would only sedate a patient if they were anxious or argumentative or agitated.

32:51.560 --> 32:57.160
But none of that's being documented in these records anywhere prior to the sedative.

32:59.400 --> 33:07.240
So I don't like to speculate, but it certainly sounds like the moment they have a positive

33:07.240 --> 33:14.920
COVID admission, they're placed on this path that only has one way to go.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.680
And that's straight to a ventilator.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.320
And they know the ventilator leads to death.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.480
Have you seen anything which would suggest

33:30.360 --> 33:34.760
that had your husband, I'm going to presume,

33:38.840 --> 33:45.320
been vaccinated against COVID, that there might have been a different path for his treatment?

33:45.320 --> 33:54.760
I haven't personally, because I haven't reviewed any records of anyone who was vaccinated

33:56.840 --> 34:05.640
and ended up in this situation. I've been told that there were two different treatment protocols.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.720
There was a treatment protocol for vaccinated patients, and there was a treatment protocol

34:10.280 --> 34:12.440
for unvaccinated patients. This is what I've heard.

34:13.320 --> 34:18.920
And I know a lot of this evidence is anecdotal, but at some point,

34:19.960 --> 34:26.360
things when you have 10 different medical records or sets of medical records,

34:27.000 --> 34:33.240
and they all indicate the same treatment, and the treatment had nothing to do with a respiratory illness.

34:34.840 --> 34:40.440
There was nothing done, but the steroids were inadequate.

34:40.440 --> 34:45.400
The breathing treatments weren't being done.

34:46.360 --> 34:51.080
Patients were being admitted and they needed blood.

34:51.080 --> 34:58.120
Their platelet count was ridiculously low, but they're never administered a blood transfusion.

34:59.240 --> 35:03.240
Patients going in with heart attacks, but they're not treating the patient for the heart attack.

35:03.240 --> 35:08.680
They're simply treating for a respiratory illness, and they're not even treating adequately for that.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.640
So all of these other diagnoses that they're going in for,

35:13.240 --> 35:18.360
even though they happen to treat test positive for COVID, COVID becomes the focus and everything

35:18.360 --> 35:27.480
else gets completely ignored. We have a doctor here in Florida who was actually a patient in the

35:27.480 --> 35:32.600
hospital, and he survived. He literally walked out of the hospital in a hospital gown. They

35:32.680 --> 35:37.320
wouldn't return his clothes. They tried to bake or act him, and they tied him to his bed

35:39.080 --> 35:43.160
because he was trying to advocate for his roommate and save his roommate. His roommate had bacteria

35:43.160 --> 35:46.840
on pneumonia, but they weren't giving him any antibiotics. They were literally letting him

35:46.840 --> 35:57.960
drown in pneumonia. Because they had a virus. So he's reviewing his roommate's medical record,

35:57.960 --> 36:04.440
and he's seeing that this patient has bacterial pneumonia, but the doctors in hospital are

36:04.440 --> 36:10.360
ignoring the treatment for the bacterial pneumonia and allowing this patient to just die.

36:11.560 --> 36:15.400
He actually reviewed my husband's medical records, and he said, this is premeditated murder.

36:16.840 --> 36:24.520
The infectious disease doctor is ordering labs to do diagnostic and create a treatment plan,

36:24.520 --> 36:30.840
and the pulmonologist is completely ignoring and won't allow those labs to be ordered or drawn.

36:31.880 --> 36:35.960
For seven days, the infectious disease doctor is saying, I need this, this, this, and this,

36:35.960 --> 36:43.480
so I can create a treatment plan for this infectious disease, and the pulmonologist is refusing to

36:43.480 --> 36:49.560
allow the infectious disease doctor to create a treatment plan. He said, this is premeditated

36:49.560 --> 36:59.400
murder, and he actually was kind enough to draw up a letter and address it to the attorney general

36:59.400 --> 37:04.440
as we deliver our petition. He said, please take this and submit this with your petition,

37:05.320 --> 37:10.680
and he drew up a letter and told the attorney general that what this doctor had done was no

37:10.680 --> 37:17.480
less than premeditated murder and explained it. So at this point,

37:20.680 --> 37:26.120
I've gotten the medical records, and I'm at a complete loss. I don't know what to do.

37:29.480 --> 37:37.080
I can prove that they had no consent to treat my husband with a ventilator, to do the procedure,

37:37.960 --> 37:45.000
and in my mind, that's a crime, that's battery. I can prove that they did nothing to actually help

37:45.000 --> 37:53.960
him, and everything they did caused harm. So I went to the medical board to file a complaint,

37:53.960 --> 37:57.640
I filed a complaint with the hospital, I filed a complaint with the nursing board,

37:57.640 --> 38:02.920
I filed a complaint with CMS because of their conditions of participation. There were certain

38:02.920 --> 38:07.320
things that were required by federal regulation that weren't done by the hospital.

38:08.200 --> 38:13.560
I went to the health department, I went to the accrediting agency, and I went to the police

38:13.560 --> 38:21.160
department. And every single one of them said, our hands are tight, we don't have any authority

38:21.160 --> 38:29.480
to do anything. It's a civil matter, get an attorney. Well, we're all familiar with the prep

38:29.480 --> 38:36.200
act, I'm sure, and then we're granted civil immunity. So they've literally been given a pass

38:38.200 --> 38:39.640
to commit murder for hire.

38:43.400 --> 38:51.720
And it's terrifying that these things can be done, and there's absolutely no recourse.

38:53.160 --> 38:57.000
That's why we ended up going the route of the petition.

38:59.800 --> 39:06.920
To bring these things to the attorney general's attention and bring the evidence, and maybe we

39:06.920 --> 39:15.640
can get a grand jury of regular old citizens who possibly, you know, I mean, if 20,000 people died

39:15.640 --> 39:21.480
with COVID in Oklahoma, maybe one of the people sitting on that jury will go, hey,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.680
you know, this sounds an awful lot like what happened to me.

39:26.680 --> 39:33.320
And they'll be more interested in looking into it and wanting to get some answers.

39:35.480 --> 39:43.320
Now, after this event, you don't immediately transition into being a

39:45.240 --> 39:51.000
citizen activist, if you will, you have a funeral, you have a memorial service to plan for your

39:51.000 --> 40:01.480
husband's friends and family. There's lost income to deal with. There's a variety of legal

40:01.480 --> 40:11.880
matters. And this is a, that's months. That's months where all of that is the priority on top of

40:14.200 --> 40:20.120
the shock. And an eight year old child. Your best friend is gone. Your best friend, your partner's

40:20.200 --> 40:29.960
gone. So, so again, so, so while this continues to happen with other people, with other victims,

40:31.640 --> 40:39.560
this is where your priorities have to be. When did you first decide to make a full request for

40:40.200 --> 40:41.880
these records? How long afterwards?

40:42.280 --> 40:52.440
The first set of records I received on November 15th, was that by the guy or they

40:52.440 --> 41:01.160
violent. It was by request. I got his death certificate. You're not allowed to request the

41:01.160 --> 41:07.240
records until you have a copy of the death certificate. I got the death certificate, I believe it was

41:07.240 --> 41:11.640
on November 10th. And I went back to the hospital to request the records on November 15th.

41:11.960 --> 41:18.280
Because for my own peace of mind, I had to see that kid sent for. I don't know. It was an obsession

41:18.280 --> 41:25.560
for me. Of course. Because I knew I knew I had said no. I knew I had refused. I knew my husband

41:25.560 --> 41:31.560
didn't want it. So, were you feeling any guilt here? Like maybe you worded something wrong?

41:32.520 --> 41:43.960
My guilt was that I knew he wasn't symptomatic. I knew he wasn't showing any signs of low oxygen.

41:43.960 --> 41:50.760
He wasn't, he didn't have blue lips or blue fingernails. He wasn't disoriented. He wasn't

41:50.760 --> 41:56.280
argumentative or belligerent. He got up. He got dressed. He walked out to the car. He got in the car.

41:56.280 --> 42:04.920
He didn't want to go. But he understood that when I was telling him a 77 is too low. You need

42:04.920 --> 42:12.680
oxygen. Or, you know, it starts affecting cells and tissue and, you know, lack of oxygen to the

42:12.680 --> 42:17.880
brain. But again, he wasn't symptomatic of any of these things. It was simply that number on that

42:17.880 --> 42:25.160
pulse oximeter. So that's one of your $25 device. Yeah, provided me. How would you say a

42:26.600 --> 42:33.560
objective piece of data which was used to guide your decision. You're doing the best that you

42:34.360 --> 42:43.080
have been educated to do. And it's interesting because we get sick all the time. You know,

42:43.080 --> 42:51.880
I mean, you'll get the, you'll get the flu or you'll get a cold. Why? It was so vital for me to

42:51.880 --> 42:57.960
have that piece of equipment to tell me my husband was okay. I've never put a pulse ox on his finger

42:57.960 --> 43:05.240
for, you know, any other respiratory illness. He may, that may have been what happened to him

43:05.240 --> 43:11.640
when he got sick. His pulse ox would drop into this. I don't know because he never looked that

43:12.600 --> 43:20.360
bad. But because of this climate of fear that, you know, surrounded everything COVID.

43:24.040 --> 43:29.400
I felt like that was what I needed to do to make sure that he didn't crash on me.

43:30.600 --> 43:35.720
When I wasn't expecting it, I didn't know what COVID looked like. I didn't care anything about

43:35.720 --> 43:43.960
COVID. To be honest, to that point, we didn't really believe that it even existed.

43:46.120 --> 43:51.560
And I still have my doubts. I still question whether this was just some

43:53.080 --> 44:00.360
very, very strong version of a flu or an ammonia or something along those lines.

44:01.320 --> 44:06.760
And how something just comes out of nowhere, you know, and there's the theories and I don't know

44:06.760 --> 44:18.520
that I buy into any of them. But he may have had, you know, oxygen or gas exchange problems every

44:18.520 --> 44:25.640
time he got sick and I never would have known it. I have a tremendous amount of guilt every day.

44:26.440 --> 44:30.440
I live with the fact that he didn't want to go to the hospital.

44:32.280 --> 44:38.680
Subjectively, he showed none of the symptoms that would have led me to take him to the hospital

44:38.680 --> 44:47.720
had it not been for that pulse oximeter. And what I did felt like I gave him a death sentence

44:49.320 --> 44:55.240
after I found out what happened in those records. Until I got the records, I had no idea. I thought,

44:55.240 --> 44:59.160
okay, well, it must have been COVID. He must have been sicker than I thought he was.

45:01.160 --> 45:06.520
Because that's what I was being told. The nurses, the doctors, everybody was giving me this

45:08.520 --> 45:19.560
story. They had a script that they followed. Oh, he's doing well today. But we're having

45:19.560 --> 45:26.600
problems now with his kidneys. We're having problems now with, you know, his potassium. We're

45:26.600 --> 45:35.080
having problems now with, and I bought it. Because I didn't think they had any reason to lie to me.

45:37.800 --> 45:43.480
We're in Oklahoma. You know, these people are our neighbors at the hospital. These people,

45:43.480 --> 45:51.640
their kids go to our school with our kids. You know, it's as red, it's as deep red as you can get,

45:51.640 --> 46:02.360
you know, as far as a Republican state. And we don't buy into that kind of stuff. I mean,

46:03.800 --> 46:10.120
my son's never been vaccinated. I had a healthy skepticism of the medical industry

46:10.200 --> 46:14.440
from the very beginning. I've never had him vaccinated.

46:16.520 --> 46:25.800
So I thought I was pretty aware. I thought I was fairly knowledgeable. I thought I was well

46:25.800 --> 46:34.280
read and researched. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter when you're being lied to. It doesn't matter

46:34.280 --> 46:43.320
when there is that fear of the unknown. When there's something that you're being told is out

46:43.320 --> 46:50.200
there that no one has ever seen before, that you have no idea what to expect. It could be this. It

46:50.200 --> 46:57.080
could be that you could be walking dead and fall out in the middle of the street or you could have

46:57.160 --> 47:09.720
no symptoms. The spectrum was so broad. You had no way to expect anything. You didn't know, okay,

47:09.720 --> 47:16.520
well, if I get to this point, then I'm really sick and I need to see a doctor. Or if I just

47:16.520 --> 47:23.800
have a cough, I'm okay. There's no frame of reference when you're dealing with something that is

47:23.800 --> 47:30.840
brand new and nobody, you know, the 24 seven death tickers on the TV and imagine if you're a

47:30.840 --> 47:37.160
hypochondriac, if you're someone who is a worry well, I don't believe you are. Every time you

47:37.160 --> 47:43.160
you feel a little tired, a little winded, digestion isn't working, your temperature's up, your temperature's

47:43.160 --> 47:50.360
down, whatever the case, maybe this is the COVID. And there's this right that's a steel term on this

47:50.360 --> 48:00.360
illusion of consensus between every channel. And sadly, even amongst both political parties,

48:00.360 --> 48:12.280
to an extent that is horrifying. But for even people who aren't, look, I as much as I've read

48:13.080 --> 48:23.560
and was aware, even in 2020, 2021, it still would not have taken much for even me. The right symptoms,

48:23.560 --> 48:30.040
I don't know the right situation to go. Now is the time to maybe, I don't know, I've heard things

48:30.040 --> 48:37.000
about the hospital, but maybe it'll work out better for us, you know. Well, and I was convinced I knew

48:37.080 --> 48:43.240
all the right questions to ask, I knew, I knew enough, be based on my history taking care of my

48:43.240 --> 48:50.840
mother with the respiratory failure. I knew how to monitor his status, if I had been given

48:52.680 --> 48:58.360
accurate information, if I had been told the truth about anything,

48:59.160 --> 49:06.200
I would have had, I would have had more options as far as making decisions.

49:08.920 --> 49:13.720
But there was no truth. There was no truth anywhere. There wasn't any truth on the TV. There wasn't

49:13.720 --> 49:24.200
any truth. Even alternate news wasn't giving the whole truth. It's interesting, because there's a few

49:24.200 --> 49:33.240
voices like yours and JJ's and a few others that are willing to discuss the possibility that

49:33.240 --> 49:41.720
maybe even you were wrong at some point. And when somebody's not, I'm willing to admit I'm wrong

49:41.720 --> 49:48.840
all the time. You can't advance, you can't move forward. If you can't prove yourself wrong,

49:49.480 --> 49:54.440
you have to. You can't say that you've learned anything or any nobody can say that they've

49:54.440 --> 49:58.120
learned anything. If they don't look back at themselves in the past and go, wow, what was I

49:58.120 --> 50:06.600
thinking? And what I've said in the past is on video. Well, that's it to be able to go back and

50:06.600 --> 50:16.520
review and to say, I could have been mistaken. There's a possibility that maybe what I was thinking

50:17.160 --> 50:25.640
wasn't exactly how it was. And there's nothing wrong with that. That's admirable,

50:26.760 --> 50:37.160
because that's something that you can take some measure of integrity with. Somebody that's never

50:37.160 --> 50:43.800
wrong has no integrity. I'm sorry. Yeah, that's a great way of putting it. And my audience and

50:43.880 --> 50:48.360
for everyone to feel comfortable with looking at what they believed or being willing to challenge

50:48.360 --> 50:53.880
what they people do not like to be proven wrong. It's inherently wrong. I can't explain why.

50:53.880 --> 50:58.760
Perhaps it makes us think that perhaps our brain isn't working properly. So we defend

50:58.760 --> 51:04.280
what we believe vigorously. Yeah, nobody ever wants to be

51:06.200 --> 51:09.640
nobody ever wants to admit they've made a mistake. Because if you've made a mistake,

51:09.720 --> 51:13.720
then you did something foolish and nobody wants to look and face themselves and say,

51:14.600 --> 51:22.920
you're not the person you thought you were. Or, but, and like I said, I thought I was

51:23.640 --> 51:29.640
pretty well informed. I always looked at the vaccine. The reason we didn't take it is because

51:29.640 --> 51:33.800
they always said follow the science, but they never showed you the science. And I said, okay,

51:33.800 --> 51:37.320
if you're telling me to follow the science, but you're not showing me the science,

51:37.320 --> 51:40.600
that's not science, that's manipulation. Correct. Correct.

51:41.800 --> 51:47.800
So you're manipulating me and I don't, I don't take well to that. I don't like to be manipulated.

51:50.040 --> 51:57.960
Again, I was, I just didn't realize I was. And now the anxiety that it comes and the trauma that

51:57.960 --> 52:10.280
comes along with knowing that I was fooled, that they were able to pull this off right under my

52:10.280 --> 52:17.320
nose. There is a level of anxiety with every aspect of my life now.

52:19.720 --> 52:27.480
I, it's a PTSD. It really is because now I have a child and I'm scared to death. He plays

52:27.560 --> 52:32.360
football. If he breaks his arm and I have to take him to the emergency room to have his arm set

52:32.360 --> 52:39.320
and they give him a COVID test. Are they going to admit him? Are they going to try to administer

52:39.320 --> 52:44.600
remdesivir? And if I argue with that, am I going to be declared an unfit parent? Am I going to lose

52:44.600 --> 52:51.880
custody of my child? Because I won't agree with the hospital's course of treatment. They do this,

52:51.880 --> 53:00.440
we know they do this. So I always, I now live with guilt, with anxiety, with fear, with trauma.

53:03.640 --> 53:10.040
The only way that I can work through that is I've found that if I'm not being productive,

53:10.040 --> 53:19.480
I'm being destructive. Parts of my life start to suffer if I'm not actively working

53:20.360 --> 53:25.160
and fighting this fight. And I think that's a trauma response too.

53:29.320 --> 53:37.880
But I can't leave this world for my son the way it is now without trying to make a change.

53:40.680 --> 53:41.080
Amen.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.720
How has this impacted your son and your husband's son?

53:50.200 --> 54:01.560
My son is, he's a lot stronger than I am. He has been able to put this in a perspective that

54:02.520 --> 54:10.760
I'm not capable of. He knows his dad's in heaven, watching down over him, keeping track of him.

54:11.560 --> 54:18.440
But I, I, I grieve my husband and my relationship and my partner and my best friend.

54:19.960 --> 54:28.120
But the fact that my son's father was stolen makes me angry because a boy needs a dad.

54:29.400 --> 54:33.720
He needs that male role model. He's going to grow up

54:35.800 --> 54:41.400
and need things that I'm not going to be able to provide. He's,

54:44.920 --> 54:47.560
he's going to have questions that I won't be able to answer.

54:49.560 --> 54:53.720
He's going to have problems that I can't solve.

54:55.560 --> 54:59.880
And his father was such an amazing man. He was such a good father.

55:00.520 --> 55:07.720
He, he coached his football, taught him baseball, took him hunting, went fishing with him,

55:07.720 --> 55:10.600
you know, from the time he could walk, we were out with fish and bowls.

55:10.760 --> 55:23.720
And it makes me angry, very, very angry that my son's future, his identity, who he's going

55:23.720 --> 55:35.160
to grow into as a man has been permanently altered by the simple fact that he doesn't have his dad.

55:35.160 --> 55:44.360
To guide him, to teach him to, I mean, I can help him understand how important it is to be a

55:44.360 --> 55:48.360
gentleman, but I can't teach him what it means to be a man.

55:51.560 --> 55:55.720
And that breaks my heart.

55:57.960 --> 56:04.680
That's the part that hurts the most is, and my son didn't even have a choice.

56:05.240 --> 56:09.400
He had no say in this matter at all. He couldn't have said,

56:09.400 --> 56:16.120
Daddy, don't go to the hospital. He had no voice. Everything happened to him.

56:23.080 --> 56:29.400
I apologize. That's, that's, that's the part that hurts the most.

56:29.480 --> 56:33.400
It is a child whose

56:38.920 --> 56:45.160
entire identity will be different without the influence of his dad.

56:49.800 --> 56:54.040
So I fight for him. And that's all I can do.

56:59.800 --> 57:05.000
So this happens to less other children as well.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.400
How would people reach you if they want to,

57:14.360 --> 57:19.240
if you are available for helping others in this capacity, conversations,

57:19.240 --> 57:23.480
whatever, do you have a preferred email I can share or something?

57:23.480 --> 57:29.640
It's Leslie bats at outlook.com. Okay, thank you.

57:34.280 --> 57:39.400
Um, thank you Leslie so much for your time today for sharing this, your story.

57:40.520 --> 57:47.000
If there's ever any more you want to share or updates, the door is open, of course, and

57:54.200 --> 57:57.320
it's. Thank you for the work you do.

57:59.640 --> 58:05.880
It doesn't feel like it's enough. Um, I'm sorry, I couldn't, I couldn't have helped your family more.

58:10.840 --> 58:12.600
Sad thing is I don't think anyone could have.

58:14.200 --> 58:16.920
Because we didn't know we didn't know what was happening in there.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.200
No one did if you weren't inside.

58:21.000 --> 58:23.560
None of us knew I didn't know you didn't know.

58:26.120 --> 58:31.000
And, uh, we shouldn't feel guilt that you should not feel guilt that you didn't know.

58:34.280 --> 58:40.120
And it's a false guilt. And I recognize that you can only,

58:41.240 --> 58:44.760
you can only do what you can do with the information you have at the time.

58:45.560 --> 58:51.400
And I made the best decisions that I could make with the information I had.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.960
I just didn't have enough information.

58:55.960 --> 59:02.200
And I want to try to make sure that the next person isn't in the same situation.

59:02.760 --> 59:06.520
It doesn't fall into the same circumstance just because they didn't have enough information.

59:07.000 --> 59:16.600
I think you're doing that. I think many people will see this. It will have a large reach. I hope.

59:17.320 --> 59:18.360
I will fight for that.

59:20.360 --> 59:23.880
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. God bless.

59:25.240 --> 59:29.000
God bless you as well. That's a very good interview. It's ill.

59:29.800 --> 59:32.440
Take me maybe two days to go through the edits.

59:33.400 --> 59:37.400
And that's fine. If there's any, I sent you a little bit of stuff.

59:37.400 --> 59:42.200
If there's anything that catches your attention that you want documentation on,

59:43.480 --> 59:48.600
I've got files and files and files and stuff on the computer. I can shoot over.

59:50.360 --> 59:59.240
You know, I mean everything from the medication, FDA data, you know, access labels to oxygen

59:59.320 --> 01:00:07.080
toxicity to pneumomediostinum, you know, ventilator injuries to the medical records.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:15.480
So if there's anything that you want as far as that goes, just let me know and I'll be happy to get that to you.
