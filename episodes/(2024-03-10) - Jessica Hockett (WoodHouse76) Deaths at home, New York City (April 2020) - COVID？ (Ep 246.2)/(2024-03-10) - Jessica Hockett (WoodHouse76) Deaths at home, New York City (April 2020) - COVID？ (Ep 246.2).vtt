00:00.000 --> 00:06.360
Hello hello hello twelve thirty four p.m. recording time Thursday March 7th

00:06.360 --> 00:11.040
2024 actually got to date right how's that for a good start I can't tell you

00:11.040 --> 00:16.040
how many videos I start off with 2023 or or make the same mistake for the

00:16.040 --> 00:23.560
previous years we have returning guest today and friend her work is right in a

00:23.560 --> 00:28.360
sweet spot a unique area that no one else is covering in particular April of the

00:28.360 --> 00:34.200
year 2020 and specifically New York City the previous interview we had was

00:34.200 --> 00:41.040
episode 731 overall 246.1 this is episode 246.2 hard to believe I've

00:41.040 --> 00:47.520
almost done a hundred other recordings since you've been with us Jessica

00:47.520 --> 00:51.240
watched the previous episode by the way for the audience if you if you want to

00:51.240 --> 00:56.720
get the the backstory and an introduction to her to to her and you

00:56.720 --> 01:05.880
can still find her woodhouse76.com welcome back thank you Mark good to be

01:05.880 --> 01:11.360
back good to talk with you again absolutely you have continued to be

01:11.360 --> 01:18.000
prolific and busy and there's like there's a lot of other great researchers out

01:18.000 --> 01:23.280
there that cover very important topics as we were just reviewing medical

01:23.320 --> 01:28.240
interventions and so on and this is good it's good that all of those bases are

01:28.240 --> 01:34.680
covered but there's one area that is again super important if we are to put

01:34.680 --> 01:39.640
out the hypothesis we are a speculate that there was that there's some risk

01:39.640 --> 01:45.360
perhaps to the medical interventions wouldn't we want to review the underlying

01:45.360 --> 01:51.240
conditions the underlying situation that led to the encouragement to to have

01:51.240 --> 01:54.880
uptake of these interventions and you and I are covering different but

01:54.880 --> 02:00.640
complementary fields one of course is the mass casualty event as you described

02:00.640 --> 02:07.800
it in New York City mine is the the increases of deaths amongst the

02:07.800 --> 02:12.440
younger population younger middle-aged population often due to opioids

02:12.440 --> 02:16.240
synthetic opioids in the United States of America and addiction in general these

02:16.240 --> 02:20.840
two do have some overlap and I think that will become clear throughout this

02:20.880 --> 02:26.920
interview but to start tell us about the last couple of months what has advanced

02:26.920 --> 02:33.240
what have some of your changes in the assessment have been in your own words

02:33.240 --> 02:38.840
take it away sure I mean we'll get to some of that as I show some some data and

02:38.840 --> 02:41.560
some different things that I've been working on but yeah really in the past

02:41.560 --> 02:45.640
couple months since we've spoken I've continued to look at the biggest mass

02:45.680 --> 02:51.880
casualty event in New York City if not US history especially when it comes to

02:51.880 --> 02:57.400
something that is not directly associated with war or a force of nature like an

02:57.400 --> 03:02.960
earthquake or tidal wave or something like that an additional 27,000 extra

03:02.960 --> 03:08.440
people are reported to have died in New York City the mortality equivalent of 10

03:08.440 --> 03:12.640
September 11th events when we're talking about the World Trade Center

03:12.720 --> 03:19.040
disaster and we still have no proof no real proof that this event occurred we

03:19.040 --> 03:22.440
don't know where all the bodies went necessarily we don't have a complete

03:22.440 --> 03:28.000
list of names of the deceased we don't have the ability to obtain death

03:28.000 --> 03:32.600
certificates because that is not in accordance with New York state law so I

03:32.600 --> 03:36.280
can't just say hey give me all your death certificates make a request under

03:36.280 --> 03:43.840
under FOIA law they they say no to that so I just continue to look at

03:43.840 --> 03:48.880
different angles different data I get requests and records back all the time

03:48.880 --> 03:52.240
I'm not going to be showing this today but this weekend hopefully I'll be

03:52.240 --> 03:57.200
publishing an article that includes the deaths and that trajectory of deaths

03:57.200 --> 04:03.240
that received the FEMA federal funeral allowance that was passed that

04:03.240 --> 04:08.760
Congress passed I think in March 2021 that allowed people whose loved ones have

04:08.760 --> 04:13.800
who died of COVID or COVID on the death certificate to get up to $9,000

04:13.800 --> 04:19.120
reimbursement in the federal disaster funds through through FEMA so I got

04:19.120 --> 04:24.040
some data back related related to that but today I thought we would look at some

04:24.040 --> 04:29.360
of the home death and ambulance data some of this I've been working on with

04:29.440 --> 04:35.320
colleagues one colleague in particular Thomas Verdine who's in in Panda it's

04:35.320 --> 04:41.720
complicated data it's perplexing data and it really flies in the face of not

04:41.720 --> 04:47.360
only government narratives about what happened in New York City but also

04:47.360 --> 04:53.360
popular narratives and popular beliefs including beliefs that I held myself and

04:53.440 --> 05:00.320
had to abandon and alter as I looked at and reexamined more data and more

05:00.320 --> 05:06.880
contemporaneous reports from the time period so yeah and I'm not going to hold

05:06.880 --> 05:11.200
back on some things that I see and think at this point I think there's been a

05:11.200 --> 05:16.640
shocking dearth of speculation I think speculation and putting ideas out there

05:16.640 --> 05:21.320
is important I don't think that there should be this emphasis on you can only

05:21.360 --> 05:26.600
say things if they are absolutely a hundred percent true no you know we need

05:26.600 --> 05:30.640
to speculate we need to think about about possibilities sometimes there's

05:30.640 --> 05:36.040
some wild ideas that that we have and that end up you know being the truth or

05:36.040 --> 05:42.520
some version of the truth so yeah I'm not gonna hold back from that today is as

05:42.520 --> 05:47.720
you'll allow me and it should be interesting to look at this data who is

05:47.800 --> 05:53.760
presenting and what is the most convincing data or the most convincing

05:53.760 --> 06:00.880
person on the narrative is true there were 27,000 more people dying per month

06:00.880 --> 06:05.720
in New York City and it absolutely was just because there was a new novel

06:05.720 --> 06:09.640
respiratory virus that represented the borders of the five boroughs you're

06:09.640 --> 06:13.200
asking me who out there is actually talking about this well well first I

06:13.200 --> 06:17.960
guess that would mean someone's talking about it but nobody is nobody

06:17.960 --> 06:23.240
isn't in fact I mean there's a I see and I'm biased of course but I see a

06:23.240 --> 06:29.840
proactive resistance on the part of US especially voices and that

06:29.840 --> 06:33.960
influencers or people in the medical freedom community I mean it's it's very

06:33.960 --> 06:38.800
few people who are questioning this an exception would be Leslie Mnuchin she

06:38.800 --> 06:44.040
somebody who I was on her show a podcast last week of the week before

06:44.040 --> 06:48.480
he's the president and founder of health health freedom defense fund my

06:48.480 --> 06:55.040
experiences you know they're recent but with hers that she kind of sees the

06:55.040 --> 06:59.400
the challenges right in the discrepancies in the data and that it

06:59.400 --> 07:02.400
doesn't add up it doesn't make sense and then of course you know some colleagues

07:02.400 --> 07:07.440
within Panda not everybody but some some colleagues my colleague Jonathan

07:07.440 --> 07:12.920
Engler another colleague Martin Neil Nick Hudson I mean these are people who

07:12.920 --> 07:17.000
you know we don't have it all figured out but they are at least willing to to

07:17.000 --> 07:21.920
talk about it and and discuss it and say yeah we need some answers here but

07:21.920 --> 07:29.280
among Americans I I'm not sure you Jonathan Kui is as well right but it's

07:29.280 --> 07:34.880
not very many many people and the active resistance to talking about it or

07:34.880 --> 07:39.560
avoidance is weird to me it really is but it could just be that people have

07:39.560 --> 07:43.700
moved on or people have accepted whatever version of the story they

07:43.700 --> 07:46.560
believe is true and they don't want to move or they think other things are more

07:46.560 --> 07:51.400
important right now or they're just annoyed by me that could be it's just

07:51.400 --> 07:55.320
not interesting like perhaps it's it's not a lack of a better word salacious

07:55.320 --> 08:00.120
like you know it really intriguing pulling people in like oh is this just

08:00.120 --> 08:05.400
sound boring I mean what do you think what why won't people who are actively

08:05.400 --> 08:11.280
questioning the big narrative overall just not interested in this I think

08:11.280 --> 08:15.560
two reasons one I think they think a few things have already explained it

08:15.560 --> 08:20.720
right and that the conspiracy there was conspiracy but it's already been

08:20.720 --> 08:25.280
addressed that it's because of almost nursing home policy which by the way

08:25.280 --> 08:30.360
feeds the spread narrative and I I challenge just the I for me spread is

08:30.360 --> 08:35.400
the OG myth okay so that the nurse the nursing home policy excuse doesn't make

08:35.400 --> 08:38.440
sense with the data I've pointed that out a million times but so so that's

08:38.440 --> 08:43.600
that's number one number two they think well it's it's ventilators right

08:43.600 --> 08:47.320
ventilators and remdesivir like while that that doesn't really work with the

08:47.320 --> 08:51.440
day they either right so that people maybe have told themselves certain

08:51.480 --> 08:55.440
things and then I think the other aspect of it is it's very hard to get people's

08:55.440 --> 09:01.440
attention these days unless you have something really huge right you might

09:01.440 --> 09:06.720
remember when Naomi Wolf had myself and Jonathan Engler on her show and she

09:06.720 --> 09:10.040
was basically like well what's the story here and it's like look the story the

09:10.040 --> 09:13.400
story is that this might not have happened there's no proof of this event

09:13.400 --> 09:17.680
the government has made a claim about the number of people who died each day on

09:17.720 --> 09:21.400
the ground in New York City that that doesn't work for a lot of different

09:21.400 --> 09:26.040
reasons and we we have the names of people who died in the World Trade

09:26.040 --> 09:29.440
Center disaster we don't have anything like that we don't have a memorial

09:29.440 --> 09:33.360
listing all the people's names we don't have any kind of fundraiser that

09:33.360 --> 09:39.720
Manhattan elites are staging to sponsor a documentary on this event there's

09:39.720 --> 09:43.800
just there's silence have you heard a memorial in the works like maybe they're

09:43.800 --> 09:47.320
raising the money to etch a wall somewhere with the you know like a Vietnam

09:47.320 --> 09:51.640
memorial that would be fantastic what's funny I need to tweak this now that you

09:51.640 --> 09:57.760
brought that up a friend of mine was at an event of some kind at University of

09:57.760 --> 10:02.480
Chicago earlier this week and one of the speakers think it was sort of a

10:02.480 --> 10:07.080
diversity equity and inclusion event it wasn't wasn't around COVID but one of

10:07.080 --> 10:11.280
the speakers this pretty articulate African-American man his name escapes

10:11.320 --> 10:16.680
me right now but he funny enough brought up the fact that a COVID-19

10:16.680 --> 10:21.760
memorial was needed and that and I was like oh well okay all right I really

10:21.760 --> 10:26.960
like this this idea especially if it gets us names not only in New York City

10:26.960 --> 10:31.600
but in Chicago is as well in Detroit and some of these other places where

10:31.600 --> 10:37.800
spring 2020 saw tons of sudden death really sudden death is not a COVID

10:37.840 --> 10:44.520
shopping sudden death is spring 2020 the first three weeks post 15 days to slow

10:44.520 --> 10:49.600
the spread why aren't we honoring these victims why aren't we disclosing what

10:49.600 --> 10:57.320
exactly happened here right so you've heard of the sudden death that was said

10:57.320 --> 11:02.520
to have happened in China earlier in the pandemic late that was at the November

11:02.520 --> 11:06.360
December and there would be videos of you know some poor soul just walking home

11:06.360 --> 11:11.040
carrying his groceries and he just falls into the puddle that is if he as if he

11:11.040 --> 11:18.600
was shot and I've ran this by other people who saying look I'm not a

11:18.600 --> 11:23.520
virologist but that just seems a little strange you know to just just die as if

11:23.520 --> 11:27.840
you've been shot you know but from a from a virus in the response I got was

11:27.840 --> 11:33.560
well you know those Chinese people work right up until the death

11:33.560 --> 11:42.040
place okay I guess that's the best they can do no no it's staged I mean that

11:42.040 --> 11:46.400
that's the word that I've been using for at least the past eight nine months or

11:46.400 --> 11:52.280
so this was staged Nahamish man was staged I'm in princess was staged I ran

11:52.280 --> 11:57.560
you know having well leaders killed by coronavirus do you remember that yeah

11:57.880 --> 12:04.600
staged and looking back at these things my hope is to be a part of and I'm not

12:04.600 --> 12:08.320
able to do it by myself right people have different areas of interest and focus

12:08.320 --> 12:14.160
but by looking back at these events and and highlighting certain videos I do

12:14.160 --> 12:18.800
this a lot on Twitter me like does does this make sense what this person was

12:18.800 --> 12:23.560
saying I get that we were all confused at the time oh yeah because it was a

12:23.600 --> 12:29.640
shock and I would say it was a shock and awe campaign planned and implemented but

12:29.640 --> 12:34.120
you know we now we have the benefit of hindsight hindsight literally is 2020

12:34.120 --> 12:38.680
and and figuratively when we go back and talk about what actually happened

12:38.680 --> 12:47.040
what for example Ron Johnson was saying at the time what ran Paul was saying at

12:47.040 --> 12:53.080
the time can we not give US senators who are sitting in office at that time a

12:53.120 --> 12:58.720
pass right and that that's uncomfortable for people it's uncomfortable for people

12:58.720 --> 13:03.000
because I think it it shocks a lot of people's narratives it doesn't matter

13:03.000 --> 13:08.520
if they were Covidian and all in or they're on the early treatment front or any

13:08.520 --> 13:13.640
of these other sectors if you will in the in the Covid discussion I think going

13:13.640 --> 13:18.320
back and talking about early 2020 is uncomfortable but they were early Covid

13:18.320 --> 13:24.160
survivors Tim Cain that Tim Cain Ron Paul and Ron Johnson were the three US

13:24.160 --> 13:27.800
senators who are in the early Covid survivors dot-com list because they

13:27.800 --> 13:32.720
all had Covid and survived the ordeal within the first three months of 2020 my

13:32.720 --> 13:37.320
cutoff is March at the end of March it's like well now the narratives it's

13:37.320 --> 13:41.320
spreading it's not as incredible but the people that are on that list is quite

13:41.320 --> 13:45.920
well and with Rand Paul I can just interject because I was looking back at

13:45.920 --> 13:52.000
the sequence of events with him in in March you know he's asymptomatic gets

13:52.000 --> 13:57.440
tested because some other people at an event in Kentucky tested positive he's

13:57.440 --> 14:02.760
not sick but then he's doing the right thing and quarantining you know issues

14:02.760 --> 14:07.880
a statement and then oh he doesn't have to show up to vote on the cares act huh

14:07.880 --> 14:14.560
that's a good point is that weird to you I mean you don't have to be a so-called

14:14.560 --> 14:18.800
conspiracy theorist and I hate that term I like to just say theorist right or

14:18.800 --> 14:23.920
collusion theorist is I think Nick Hudson's term for it but can we just go back

14:23.920 --> 14:28.400
and say that that's ridiculous and now this is the guy who's been on a never

14:28.400 --> 14:35.440
ending circular crusade and parade of hearings with Anthony Fauci around

14:35.440 --> 14:40.200
gain a function lab league right like that's all that's definitely staged for

14:40.200 --> 14:44.680
sure it is so yeah let's it's it's past time to call this out so that like

14:44.680 --> 14:48.760
Jonathan Kui says I mean this is really for our children right I don't want my

14:48.760 --> 14:53.760
children believing lives right my poor children are you know

14:53.760 --> 14:58.920
inculcated with with this stuff a lot for me although even my children look at

14:58.920 --> 15:03.840
the New York City graph and say yeah I don't think that happened I don't think

15:03.840 --> 15:10.560
that happened that way right so some of these visuals I'll end up posting on

15:10.560 --> 15:15.560
my substack woodhouse76.com you know when you're looking at death data all the

15:15.560 --> 15:21.320
time sometimes you make death jokes so it's maybe a little bit inappropriate but

15:21.320 --> 15:25.960
I decided to title this this set of visuals stay home save lives slow the

15:25.960 --> 15:33.480
spread look they're dead because New York City had an incredible number of home

15:33.480 --> 15:39.720
deaths death set at at people's homes hospitals still had the most by quite

15:39.720 --> 15:44.520
a margin nursing homes had quite a bit but the home death toll is one that

15:44.520 --> 15:50.680
doesn't get talked about enough in in my opinion and just for review by way of

15:50.680 --> 15:57.040
review this is what the daily death curve for New York City looks like 2019 through

15:57.040 --> 16:02.880
2020 I actually now have all the way back to 1999 daily deaths I need to put

16:02.880 --> 16:07.640
that out soon it's really interesting to see that but as I pointed out many

16:07.640 --> 16:14.720
times we don't see anything going on absolutely nothing until the feds say

16:14.720 --> 16:22.600
15 days to slow the spread and then we see an incredible I think almost 750

16:22.600 --> 16:28.400
percent something like that from base to peak increase in daily deaths and then

16:28.440 --> 16:34.160
almost as incredibly maybe even more incredibly we see a drop to baseline

16:34.160 --> 16:40.040
little bit below baseline and it stays that way really for the rest of the

16:40.040 --> 16:44.120
year starts to creep up again a little bit at the end of 2020 but it's not

16:44.120 --> 16:49.280
really any that that's not really notable compared to previous years or

16:49.280 --> 16:54.840
previous flu flu seasons when it's a date that it started to this precipitous drop

16:54.880 --> 16:58.720
it's somewhere in the middle of the month what's the approximate date and you

16:58.720 --> 17:02.160
know it's interesting to look at this data by place of death which I'll show

17:02.160 --> 17:07.080
you in a second but yeah I mean it goes back down to baseline so somebody

17:07.080 --> 17:10.360
pointed this out to me today that it goes back down to baseline a couple days

17:10.360 --> 17:16.000
before George Floyd happened I was like oh I never noticed that before so it's

17:16.000 --> 17:22.720
something like by by the very end of May you know we're we're very much back to

17:22.720 --> 17:27.360
normal when it comes to all caused deaths happening each day you know

17:27.360 --> 17:31.560
regardless of place so it's it's just incredible I don't have this slide

17:31.560 --> 17:35.680
available right now but I mean you look at New York compared to Chicago and

17:35.680 --> 17:41.480
Chicago experienced a hundred percent or so increase in in deaths during this

17:41.480 --> 17:45.800
time but their event started a little later than New York City's even though

17:45.800 --> 17:50.880
they announced a COVID case about six weeks before I'm also be interested in

17:50.880 --> 17:56.400
you know New York Elizabeth 10 Yonkers you know the surrounding towns if you

17:56.400 --> 18:00.480
cross the street and no one's dying anymore well the Metro a lot of people

18:00.480 --> 18:04.320
commute into New York City by the way I mean everyone knows this of course yeah

18:04.320 --> 18:09.360
I mean the met the Metro area really accounts for all of America I mean

18:09.360 --> 18:15.160
pretty pretty much like the the spring 2020 event you know it it happened

18:15.160 --> 18:20.920
basically in the New York City Metro area and then a few other places right

18:20.920 --> 18:24.760
when it comes to that Seattle funny enough King County Sohamish County

18:24.760 --> 18:30.320
didn't experience very much excess in this period at all because they did the

18:30.320 --> 18:35.640
right thing right they did the right thing but New York was attacked right

18:35.640 --> 18:40.880
the most disaster prepared city in the world was attacked it was caught off

18:40.920 --> 18:46.000
guard this is the narrative right it was caught off guard by a cold virus but it

18:46.000 --> 18:50.480
fought back and showed everybody how it was done I mean that that's the kind of

18:50.480 --> 18:56.960
Hollywood storyline that they were telling and are still telling about this

18:56.960 --> 19:02.680
this event what's even more incredible to me in some ways is if you separate the

19:02.760 --> 19:09.320
COVID deaths the deaths that were attributed to COVID-19 as underlying

19:09.320 --> 19:15.480
cause versus the deaths that were not again you see something that looks like

19:15.480 --> 19:21.240
a bomb but you also see that so there was non-COVID access of course that we

19:21.240 --> 19:26.440
already knew that so even with the liberal interpretation of what a COVID death is

19:26.440 --> 19:30.760
assuming anyone with the respiratory virus or something similar to the flu is

19:30.760 --> 19:34.280
COVID I don't know how much of that was put into place please elaborate even

19:34.280 --> 19:39.960
with that there was still more death overall not just like a couple but a

19:39.960 --> 19:45.880
few thousand which were not COVID even when interpreting the cause of death

19:45.880 --> 19:51.720
in a very forgiving liberal way yeah sure about seven thousand or so

19:51.720 --> 19:57.240
non non-COVID deaths in this time New York's definition at this time was

19:57.240 --> 20:03.640
60 days within 60 days of the death there was a positive COVID test now

20:03.640 --> 20:08.920
what the narrative is on that though is that in the non-COVID people tell you

20:08.920 --> 20:13.240
that well there's so many deaths that we missed right we didn't have enough

20:13.240 --> 20:17.720
tests even though New York City was doing more tests than anyone the bulk of

20:17.720 --> 20:22.200
testing being done in the first three weeks of this event in New York City was

20:22.200 --> 20:26.520
the bulk of the test being done in America so and New York had its own test

20:26.520 --> 20:30.040
New York State Wadsworth lab they they had their own test going

20:30.040 --> 20:34.440
here they had a said they had a 70% positivity rate

20:34.440 --> 20:38.520
that's maybe off topic for now but just just keep just keep that in mind

20:38.520 --> 20:42.120
but yes you're right I would never say that New York City didn't have excess

20:42.120 --> 20:47.160
death what I question is the representation of this event did this

20:47.160 --> 20:54.840
event happen as presented and I say no I'm calling BS on it if you will

20:54.920 --> 20:59.480
the non-COVID excess also goes away when we're only looking at all

20:59.480 --> 21:02.840
causing that other slide there's other slices of the data you can look at like

21:02.840 --> 21:05.880
home deaths stay elevated for the rest of the year

21:05.880 --> 21:11.480
certain kinds of deaths stay elevated right but it makes no sense

21:11.480 --> 21:17.720
that after this 11 week period less than that for non-COVID deaths

21:17.720 --> 21:21.080
you know we're just back to normal situation normal

21:21.080 --> 21:26.040
back here in in New York City even though there's still mitigations going on

21:26.040 --> 21:30.200
we've got 8.5 million people in the city I get that some people left right the

21:30.200 --> 21:34.040
the best estimate I've read is 450,000 Manhattanites left

21:34.040 --> 21:38.840
for the Hamptons or upstate or what what have you but it's just ridiculous

21:38.840 --> 21:43.560
no lingering illness if you were unfortunate enough to catch the novel

21:43.560 --> 21:47.880
respiratory virus as it's spreading around either you died in that month or

21:47.880 --> 21:50.760
everyone got better which makes you think well

21:50.760 --> 21:56.440
why did they ever need a jab if everyone everyone survived exposure

21:56.440 --> 22:01.000
who had it at a certain period of time well not only that so this what's funny

22:01.000 --> 22:05.960
what I've realized over time is that this also fed the herd immunity argument

22:05.960 --> 22:11.240
see it all feeds the novel virus there was a novel virus that was spreading

22:11.240 --> 22:16.520
suddenly from perfect person this if you hear J about a chariot or maybe even

22:16.600 --> 22:20.120
Michael Levitt or some other some other people talk about New York to the

22:20.120 --> 22:23.080
extent that they will talk about New York these days

22:23.080 --> 22:28.440
their idea is that it was maybe a different variant or it spread really

22:28.440 --> 22:31.000
quickly in New York City and it burned through right

22:31.000 --> 22:35.720
so you can see how New York City served the government narrative

22:35.720 --> 22:43.160
in so many different way right but it's incredible to look look back on

22:43.160 --> 22:46.200
as we try to get into home deaths here I just want to show

22:46.200 --> 22:50.360
the viewers and you know remind remind us that one of the

22:50.360 --> 22:56.600
many red flags about this event is that we had basically all places of death

22:56.600 --> 23:00.840
all settings of death rise at the same time

23:00.840 --> 23:05.560
or let me speak for myself that is not what I would expect if there was a

23:05.560 --> 23:09.560
novel deadly virus silently spreading on the loose

23:09.560 --> 23:14.600
you would expect to maybe start to see certain places of death rise first and

23:14.600 --> 23:19.080
we could debate what those might be you know depending on the situation or

23:19.080 --> 23:24.040
what we would assume about such a pathogen right but instead we see this

23:24.040 --> 23:29.400
15 days to slow the spread isn't that incredible

23:29.400 --> 23:34.200
so hospital inpatient it well for me that's the most fraudulent

23:34.200 --> 23:39.400
right it's either fraudulent or it says we we euthanized everybody who was

23:39.400 --> 23:43.240
already in the hospital which color is actually hard to tell the color from

23:43.240 --> 23:51.080
the top line is hospital inpatient home and nursing home are roughly the same

23:51.080 --> 23:56.920
percent increase ish okay and then although this isn't percent this is

23:56.920 --> 24:01.800
raw but I know the percentages too okay so they're comparable

24:01.800 --> 24:08.600
emergency department outpatient that excess lasts only about six weeks

24:08.600 --> 24:13.960
if that and it goes back down I combined in this data

24:13.960 --> 24:18.040
DOA which means dead on arrival to the hospital so ambulance picks you up and

24:18.040 --> 24:21.560
brings you to the health care setting but you you died on route

24:21.560 --> 24:25.640
hospice facility and other places because there are some suppressed values when

24:25.640 --> 24:29.080
you're looking at daily in the daily data set that I was provided

24:29.080 --> 24:36.920
it's super sus by the way super sus that DOA and hospice facility don't go up

24:36.920 --> 24:40.440
that's weird do you know mark that according to the New York City vital

24:40.440 --> 24:45.400
statistics report of 2020 there were only 15 covid deaths in New York City

24:45.400 --> 24:51.480
hospice facilities that's incredible don't you think

24:51.480 --> 24:55.160
that's incredible there was something like 16 000

24:55.160 --> 25:00.520
in hospital and outpatient I'm so glad that New York City kept

25:00.520 --> 25:05.480
covid out of its hospice facilities but let it into the nursing home

25:05.480 --> 25:09.080
facilities I think that's I think that's really weird

25:09.080 --> 25:15.000
if someone in hospice is is if they're health is slowly deteriorating

25:15.000 --> 25:20.280
and if they are given medications to slowly put them at rest

25:20.280 --> 25:23.720
would the death code be something not covid if they

25:23.720 --> 25:28.280
already did have if they did have covid or so that's so that's well I don't

25:28.280 --> 25:32.600
know what we mean by have covid but they have covid but you know they're in

25:32.680 --> 25:36.760
the process of dying anyway so you know you're in your final weekend

25:36.760 --> 25:40.440
you know it's bad enough and then you have to go out with covid

25:40.440 --> 25:46.520
um so well maybe in a hospice facility were hospice facilities weren't paid

25:46.520 --> 25:51.320
extra money for covid deaths were they not not to my knowledge i'm not

25:51.320 --> 25:55.160
facility patients could also like nursing home residents

25:55.160 --> 25:59.400
be moved into hospitals transported into hospitals

25:59.400 --> 26:05.640
to help staging efforts if you were running a live exercise simulation

26:05.640 --> 26:08.600
involving so if someone's dying in hospice care

26:08.600 --> 26:13.640
um they perhaps you yesterday they may be gone in two or three days

26:13.640 --> 26:18.200
there's no extra money but if they happen to pass away in the hospital down the

26:18.200 --> 26:21.000
street there's i don't know an extra twenty thousand dollars

26:21.000 --> 26:26.280
and another potential explanation is an executive order that Andrew Cuomo

26:26.680 --> 26:31.320
issued on march 23rd there's many things that are interesting in that order but

26:31.320 --> 26:35.960
they allowed hospice facility to have dual certification as inpatient

26:35.960 --> 26:41.480
vets so does the hospital inpatient toll include

26:41.480 --> 26:45.480
some hospice facility people it's interesting to think about

26:45.480 --> 26:48.840
but you know what we're really interested in today

26:48.840 --> 26:54.840
is the home death toll no sign of anything

26:54.840 --> 27:02.520
going on until president trump says 15 days to slow the spread and then

27:02.520 --> 27:08.040
boom it's almost vertical in the first week

27:08.040 --> 27:13.640
yes so he said that on march 16th 2020 15 days to slow the spread i think it

27:13.640 --> 27:18.040
march about 31 day month so the number of deaths occurring at

27:18.040 --> 27:22.520
home started the day after that or two days after that or i mean

27:22.680 --> 27:27.080
yeah basically this is this is cdc data which is weekly

27:27.080 --> 27:30.840
not the other step i was showing you is daily but yes it's it's more or less

27:30.840 --> 27:34.440
right after that you know i think the 18th or 19th i don't have the dates right

27:34.440 --> 27:38.120
in front of me but there's nothing going on but before then

27:38.120 --> 27:42.040
what's really interesting too i'll show this one first and then i'll go back

27:42.040 --> 27:45.640
cdc data and the and the new york state new york city data

27:45.640 --> 27:50.600
more or less in agreement no no no no okay they're not i can post

27:50.600 --> 27:54.840
something about that on sub stack maybe um we'll get at that later but

27:54.840 --> 27:57.800
there's differences yeah there's difference there they're not the kind

27:57.800 --> 28:00.120
of differences though that would account for huge

28:00.120 --> 28:04.680
bulks of deaths the cdc data for for deaths at

28:04.680 --> 28:07.160
deaths at its home when you look by age group

28:07.160 --> 28:14.200
shows increases again simultaneous increases across all adult age groups

28:14.200 --> 28:17.400
now with the younger groups you're gonna be like well that's not very much but

28:17.400 --> 28:21.880
it actually is quite a bit a table might be better to to look at if you're

28:21.880 --> 28:26.360
looking at weeks 12 so this is mid march you know march 15th or so

28:26.360 --> 28:32.280
until um may 30th in this data set i mean we see

28:32.280 --> 28:38.120
175 to you know over 200 increase in deaths at home at

28:38.120 --> 28:43.320
every age group every age group for adults

28:43.320 --> 28:47.240
that is astounding now obviously raw number is highest

28:47.240 --> 28:51.720
at the older age levels but you've more than doubled your

28:51.720 --> 28:57.480
your deaths for ages 25 to 44 what well you're it's almost

28:57.480 --> 29:02.040
yeah it's almost doubled well it's almost it's almost a factor of three

29:02.040 --> 29:06.920
almost yeah yeah it's absolutely ridiculous and so

29:06.920 --> 29:12.120
overall we see that we have this tremendous

29:12.120 --> 29:17.800
increase in deaths at home so what the flip was going on

29:17.800 --> 29:22.280
is this DOA or is this also include they were unresponsive and then they

29:22.280 --> 29:24.520
brought to the hospital in dead or they were

29:24.520 --> 29:27.800
pronounced they're announced as dead at home

29:27.800 --> 29:32.920
great great question so yes that that at home so DOA in the in the data i was

29:32.920 --> 29:36.360
showing you here it was like on the death certificate where the

29:36.360 --> 29:40.680
person died so DOA in this data is the person was

29:40.680 --> 29:45.560
brought to the hospital or transported somewhere and they were dead on arrival

29:45.560 --> 29:49.960
so they were alive or considered alive when they were put into the ambulance

29:49.960 --> 29:52.280
but then they were dead when they got there

29:52.280 --> 29:56.120
that that's what DOA in this data set is when we're talking about deaths at home

29:56.120 --> 30:00.040
in general it would be many people who were pronounced

30:00.040 --> 30:03.400
dead on the scene does that make sense so dead on

30:03.400 --> 30:08.120
dead on or either dead on arrival like i show up in the person's dead

30:08.120 --> 30:11.640
right if i'm an EMT or i show up

30:11.640 --> 30:16.040
the person doesn't have a pulse or we try to revive the person

30:16.040 --> 30:19.880
and they die i was curious how many it looks like there might have been a

30:19.880 --> 30:22.680
little bump but if there was you know suddenly

30:22.680 --> 30:27.480
several thousand people dying from pickup to drop off

30:27.480 --> 30:31.080
which i don't think there is but that that along with everything else would

30:31.080 --> 30:33.720
be pretty suspicious remember that you said that though

30:33.720 --> 30:37.320
we'll we'll get back to that because that is suspicious

30:37.320 --> 30:41.560
the lack of real rise in DOA in this data set

30:41.560 --> 30:45.320
is sus so let's go back to cause for just a second

30:45.320 --> 30:50.040
this graph is also from cdc wonder and what i did here is i took

30:50.040 --> 30:54.040
some of the big categories the bigger categories

30:54.040 --> 30:57.960
so not specific things within each category but the bigger the bigger

30:57.960 --> 31:01.560
categories so like neoplasm is cancer right and then there's all kinds of

31:01.560 --> 31:05.080
cancers that are within that but the big categories

31:05.080 --> 31:09.320
and the categories where there was a fairly significant

31:09.320 --> 31:14.040
increase during this time so remember this is only deaths at home

31:14.040 --> 31:20.440
we see a massive rise in heart-related deaths

31:20.440 --> 31:25.320
absolutely massive and it's immediate it's right away

31:25.320 --> 31:30.280
then we also see something that is ridiculous to me and has always been

31:30.280 --> 31:34.120
ridiculous to me the idea that people are dying

31:34.120 --> 31:39.000
suddenly of covid-19 at home

31:39.160 --> 31:44.520
what's interesting about this view of the data is that we can see

31:44.520 --> 31:50.920
that the covid death curve and the heart death curve

31:50.920 --> 31:58.120
are the same shape very similar profile so based for a lot of reasons that i

31:58.120 --> 32:01.400
won't get into right now but for a lot of reasons

32:01.400 --> 32:09.320
i believe that that blue line is deaths at home for which

32:09.320 --> 32:14.280
a positive test was secured so that could include heart deaths

32:14.280 --> 32:19.320
it could include Alzheimer's deaths it could cut across categories

32:19.320 --> 32:24.200
but those were the deaths for which there was a record of positive test

32:24.200 --> 32:27.960
or they were the body was swabbed and they got a positive test

32:27.960 --> 32:31.720
what's interesting is if you go back and you read

32:31.720 --> 32:35.480
contemporaneous news reports at the time

32:35.880 --> 32:38.680
and remember news was controlled at this time

32:38.680 --> 32:42.440
so the idea that anything that was being said

32:42.440 --> 32:46.760
was not what the government wanted us to hear think

32:46.760 --> 32:53.400
is ridiculous so at this time there were announcements from officials

32:53.400 --> 32:57.000
about we're not autopsying you know the normal number of

32:57.000 --> 33:00.840
home deaths we're not able there's not enough tests

33:00.840 --> 33:06.200
for us to test all these bodies so there was this shortage idea

33:06.200 --> 33:09.960
right and this idea of we're missing deaths at home

33:09.960 --> 33:14.840
we're missing covid deaths at home the virus is killing people

33:14.840 --> 33:18.040
at home that that was in print or that was said

33:18.040 --> 33:22.280
oh sure yeah and in fact New York City added

33:22.280 --> 33:27.880
on April 14th they dumped something like 3,000 3,500

33:27.880 --> 33:32.680
probable covid deaths into the covid death toll

33:32.680 --> 33:35.800
I have some theories about that that we might get to later

33:35.800 --> 33:38.840
if you look at this heart death curve for Chicago

33:38.840 --> 33:42.200
for Cook County it doesn't even come close

33:42.200 --> 33:46.840
it does not even come close there's a rise in heart related deaths at home

33:46.840 --> 33:50.600
in Chicago as well Cook County as well but it's nothing

33:50.600 --> 33:55.640
compared to this so on the basis of that alone

33:55.640 --> 34:00.280
we have to ask ourselves what the flip happened in New York City

34:00.280 --> 34:03.800
are we to think that New Yorkers are simply more panicked

34:03.800 --> 34:07.640
than everybody else but here's something else really astounding

34:07.640 --> 34:11.160
too related to this before we look at the ambulance data

34:11.240 --> 34:17.320
is that if you look in CDC wonder at deaths at home

34:17.320 --> 34:20.680
that attributed covid-19 as underlying cause

34:20.680 --> 34:27.080
New York City versus everybody in April 2020

34:27.080 --> 34:33.160
40 percent of such deaths are in New York

34:33.160 --> 34:37.640
how is that possible New York City only comprises

34:37.640 --> 34:42.920
not even 3% of the US population 2.7% I believe

34:42.920 --> 34:49.080
how is it possible that they have well a covid death at home I have questions

34:49.080 --> 34:54.520
about anyway right but 40% of those are there

34:54.520 --> 34:58.280
it could be 5% with including the US that New York City Metro

34:58.280 --> 35:03.080
either way this is only the five boroughs by the way

35:03.080 --> 35:06.920
oh no this is anytime I show you New York City

35:06.920 --> 35:10.440
in a data set thank you so it's even more absurd

35:10.440 --> 35:14.760
that is yep it's even more absurd it's very hard to

35:14.760 --> 35:18.600
just hard to explain very hard to explain that it's it's it's

35:18.600 --> 35:24.360
absurd so when we look at the 911 call an ambulance data which

35:24.360 --> 35:28.840
the EMT dispatch set is very very complicated it's huge and I've

35:28.840 --> 35:32.760
had a couple people help me with it it's even hard just to down to

35:32.760 --> 35:36.440
download it's very counter counter narrative and so

35:36.440 --> 35:39.640
just to summarize the things about it that are pretty pretty counter

35:39.640 --> 35:42.120
narrative and then I'll show I'll show each one

35:42.120 --> 35:46.520
in contrast to what the government would have us believe and and what many

35:46.520 --> 35:49.880
people believe some things that I used to believe

35:49.880 --> 35:56.520
people called 911 you'll see that there's a big rise in

35:56.520 --> 36:00.520
ambulance dispatches it's not it doesn't match the

36:01.320 --> 36:05.240
that proportional to the death spike but it's there's a big there's a big

36:05.240 --> 36:08.920
rise there were some changes though in the

36:08.920 --> 36:15.960
types of calls that people made some of which I find really alarming

36:15.960 --> 36:21.000
lots of medical help was dispatched so big increase and so the people who

36:21.000 --> 36:24.280
say if anybody's listening like I was in New York I heard the sirens I

36:24.280 --> 36:29.400
agree there were more sirens there were more responses okay yeah I agree

36:29.480 --> 36:32.600
with you there was there were more dispatches that's what the data set

36:32.600 --> 36:37.960
shows but ambulances transporting patients at

36:37.960 --> 36:42.440
first they they stay kind of normal and then they drop

36:42.440 --> 36:47.160
after I think March 25th when the CARES Act was passed

36:47.240 --> 36:54.680
there is a massive rise in refused medical help

36:55.400 --> 36:58.840
tons of patients were pronounced dead at the scene

36:58.840 --> 37:01.960
and most of those especially in the first few weeks

37:01.960 --> 37:07.320
were cardiac cardiac related or cardiac arrest

37:08.440 --> 37:15.640
there was a series of orders and decisions made with respect to

37:15.640 --> 37:23.720
emergency medical services that can explain some of the data that we see

37:23.800 --> 37:30.040
but they don't explain why people were in cardiac arrest

37:30.040 --> 37:33.000
why the calls were being made good point

37:34.680 --> 37:38.040
so let's look at some of this data so that you know I don't just make statements

37:38.040 --> 37:41.160
without without evidence okay here's a good question um

37:41.160 --> 37:46.200
these are evidence that there were more calls for cardiac

37:46.200 --> 37:51.480
arrest assistance at home before I should say in this month than before

37:51.480 --> 37:58.600
okay I'll get to that I'll get to that so the the first data set just to look

37:58.600 --> 38:06.200
at is so this is ambulances dispatched in response to 911 calls

38:06.200 --> 38:10.680
I have the full data set like back to 2005 and then going forward but I'm

38:10.680 --> 38:13.480
just going to show this for now I'm just going to show these periods of

38:13.480 --> 38:16.440
September 1st 2019 so there's a sense of baseline

38:16.520 --> 38:24.120
and until September 1st 2020 so nothing is going on there's nothing

38:24.120 --> 38:30.360
really abnormal or notable until 15 days to slow the spread is called

38:30.360 --> 38:36.360
and then pretty immediately we see this huge jump

38:36.360 --> 38:41.160
in ambulance dispatches so when people say well

38:41.160 --> 38:44.760
you know the reason that emergency department visits were down and it's

38:44.760 --> 38:48.520
true emergency department visits were down we'll look at that but

38:48.520 --> 38:50.680
well it's because people were staying away from the hospital they were

38:50.680 --> 38:53.400
afraid to go to the hospital well if they were afraid to go to the hospital

38:53.400 --> 38:56.680
then why don't we see the increase in calls

38:56.680 --> 39:01.480
does that make sense I mean just that if you make me feel bad that I that

39:01.480 --> 39:04.440
that this has been said and I have even questioned it but yes they're

39:04.440 --> 39:09.560
making a phone call I need help bring me to a place where I can get help

39:09.560 --> 39:13.720
right right and it I mean you go back and you look at my tweets

39:13.720 --> 39:17.640
any anybody can go back and look at my tweets I mean in 2020 I think I was

39:17.640 --> 39:20.840
saying like stay home save lives was the deadliest health public health

39:20.840 --> 39:25.160
message in history people stayed home they were afraid

39:25.160 --> 39:29.000
but you know that's what the news media was reporting at the time too

39:29.000 --> 39:32.840
like it during the event so I now realize that

39:32.840 --> 39:38.040
oh this is interesting this was like an intended this explanation

39:38.040 --> 39:41.560
is one of the explanations for what was going on

39:41.560 --> 39:43.640
and it's what the government wanted us to think

39:43.640 --> 39:47.640
so I'm not really sure that that's really what what happened here

39:47.640 --> 39:51.000
I don't know how to best describe this but have you talked to any responders

39:51.000 --> 39:54.680
or any any people that would have information on

39:54.680 --> 39:59.960
how often the calls were made by the person who was in need versus

39:59.960 --> 40:03.000
a family member of roommate or something like that

40:03.000 --> 40:08.280
no that's a good question so I have I'll say this for now I have

40:08.280 --> 40:15.080
interacted with a couple of EMTs including somebody who was working in

40:15.080 --> 40:20.520
the call center I've shown some of these data

40:20.520 --> 40:29.640
to those people the response from one that I got was that the data looks weird

40:29.640 --> 40:32.840
the person did not elaborate and I haven't talked to that person in a little

40:32.840 --> 40:37.080
while after I sent them more data but I'm not quoting directly but it was

40:37.080 --> 40:40.520
something like that like the data looks a little funny

40:40.520 --> 40:45.080
almost like they weren't expecting what I showed

40:45.080 --> 40:49.080
no further comment I don't know what else to say about that

40:49.080 --> 40:53.640
what's the characteristic that's weird again without me not say

40:53.640 --> 40:58.280
they the person didn't say it's interesting to compare this though with

40:58.280 --> 41:01.720
Chicago now this isn't exactly the same data

41:01.720 --> 41:06.120
so this is ambulances dispatched in response to 911 calls

41:06.120 --> 41:11.560
this is Chicago daily calls to EMS so okay so it's a little different

41:11.560 --> 41:16.040
but you know if we assume that the ambulance dispatches are more or less

41:16.040 --> 41:20.200
in line with the the the e m the calls to 911

41:20.200 --> 41:28.440
Chicago actually saw a drop no not huge but Chicago saw a little bit of a dip

41:28.440 --> 41:34.200
in 911 calls so when we put these two cities on the same

41:34.200 --> 41:40.440
different vertical axes same graph right what what is the explanation

41:40.440 --> 41:45.480
everything else aside for a second what is the explanation for

41:45.480 --> 41:51.240
New York goes up Chicago doesn't now I used to think it was maybe a

41:51.240 --> 41:54.120
temperament thing you know and I know I know New York

41:54.120 --> 41:58.280
New York City my husband's there today in fact I know New York City

41:58.280 --> 42:02.120
no Chicago obviously there are temperamental differences

42:02.120 --> 42:09.160
between the residents of each city right Chicago's there's there's more apathy

42:09.160 --> 42:13.320
I would say in in Chicago or New York stereotypically

42:13.320 --> 42:17.320
is more prone to intensity but I don't see

42:17.320 --> 42:21.240
again stereotypically not every New Yorker but I don't see why

42:21.240 --> 42:26.680
Donald Trump saying 15 days to slow the spread would trigger the calls

42:26.680 --> 42:31.560
in one place but not not the other well I mean that time I don't know if it was

42:31.560 --> 42:36.200
a statement that caused it that's a good point in time

42:36.200 --> 42:40.040
though it's an interesting point in time and it raises

42:40.040 --> 42:43.720
questions for me I've long had questions about

42:43.720 --> 42:47.960
and theorize this 15 days to slow the spread means something else

42:47.960 --> 42:53.000
did it activate something did it activate

42:53.000 --> 42:58.360
a response plan is it a euphemism I don't know the answer this

42:58.360 --> 43:02.440
is the data really I mean that's what it was Trump the first person to say that

43:02.440 --> 43:06.040
was that really his statement or did he reiterate

43:06.040 --> 43:08.440
I'm not trying to let the guy out the hook trust me

43:08.440 --> 43:11.240
reiterate was something that someone else said

43:11.240 --> 43:15.560
no it's it's a formal declaration it's it's a document I've I've tweeted it many

43:15.560 --> 43:22.440
times it's a formal federal document and it says 15 days to slow the

43:22.440 --> 43:26.360
the spread like an executive order of sorts yeah I don't know if it

43:26.360 --> 43:29.560
Kevin Watt would be good to ask about this actually the

43:29.560 --> 43:33.160
I don't know that it carried the weight of an executive

43:33.160 --> 43:36.920
order it was more of a prop the way I understand it

43:36.920 --> 43:42.520
not a lawyer is just more of a proclamation

43:42.520 --> 43:47.720
so did he know what he was saying

43:48.680 --> 43:52.440
I don't know I try not to get into the mind of a you know reality show president

43:52.440 --> 43:57.320
but you're fired I think that's interesting I think it's

43:57.320 --> 44:00.280
interesting because I've done so many different timelines Mark

44:00.280 --> 44:03.080
words like okay what did Cuomo say here what do you say there

44:03.080 --> 44:08.840
and what I realized is that the pivot point is the announcement of 15 days to

44:08.840 --> 44:12.120
slow the spread that's when the data changes

44:12.120 --> 44:15.800
the other thing too I just want to point out in case someone's like why

44:15.800 --> 44:19.880
didn't she comment on that you know the the dispatches go down

44:19.880 --> 44:23.480
way below baseline and they stay that way they actually stay that way for a

44:23.480 --> 44:28.040
while part of the reason for that we think

44:28.040 --> 44:35.080
is because as of April 1st they started directing more calls to telehealth to

44:35.080 --> 44:40.120
telemedicine I don't know though about the idea

44:40.120 --> 44:43.560
that there are so many ambulances normally that are

44:43.560 --> 44:46.600
dispatched you know that effectively don't need to be

44:46.600 --> 44:49.960
dispatched and could be handled by telemedicine

44:49.960 --> 44:54.920
right and we do see home deaths do stay elevated

44:54.920 --> 44:59.320
for the rest of the year not super high but they're elevated

44:59.320 --> 45:04.040
so it is interesting to me still though that in a city of 8 million people

45:04.040 --> 45:09.880
that dispatches drop and stay stay down but again that might be explained by

45:09.880 --> 45:14.120
by telehealth if we look at the call it's actually

45:14.120 --> 45:20.200
supposed to be the same data set I've emailed the author of this study

45:20.200 --> 45:23.640
who's the chief medical officer of the fire department of New York and

45:23.640 --> 45:27.560
asked him for underlying data in this study and he says

45:27.560 --> 45:31.720
he he's basically said no which is weird but this is

45:31.720 --> 45:35.240
this is aggregated data from then that they report

45:35.240 --> 45:39.400
it's my it's my table I selected certain things people can go and look at

45:39.400 --> 45:42.520
the whole whole study I'm not trying to hide anything I'm just highlighting

45:42.520 --> 45:46.360
certain things but if we look at the calls in the

45:46.360 --> 45:51.880
call types we see some pretty big increases in

45:51.880 --> 45:56.040
some kinds of calls and then decreases in other kinds

45:56.040 --> 46:01.960
general illness calls goes up respiratory goes up so I think that those are

46:01.960 --> 46:05.560
maybe some of the ones we're supposed to look at

46:05.560 --> 46:10.040
right like look people are panicking look

46:10.120 --> 46:13.640
there's a virus okay and I do think by the way that there were some

46:13.640 --> 46:16.840
there was probably some intense panic calling

46:16.840 --> 46:20.360
yeah I do think that is in the in the mix I would never say that it wasn't

46:20.360 --> 46:24.040
like okay I got a call I mean people's doctor's offices were closed

46:24.040 --> 46:29.320
or words people just yeah freaking out seeing the numbers on TV I think that

46:29.320 --> 46:32.520
that was happening so I don't want to minimize that

46:32.520 --> 46:39.480
at all but if you look at two things in particular

46:39.480 --> 46:43.560
they're alarming to me so it's very alarming to me

46:43.560 --> 46:48.200
that cardiac arrest goes up so high

46:48.360 --> 46:53.000
very high what was causing the cardiac arrests

46:53.000 --> 46:59.240
then it's also very interesting to me an alarming but for different reasons

46:59.240 --> 47:05.400
that psychiatric and drug calls go down

47:05.480 --> 47:10.360
I mean it's not the same but it's close enough to where

47:10.360 --> 47:13.720
I see the increase in cardiac arrest calls

47:13.720 --> 47:19.320
and the decrease in opioid you know or psych drug calls and I'm like huh

47:19.320 --> 47:26.680
is it possible that some cardiac arrests were drug triggered

47:26.680 --> 47:31.400
if someone has an opioid overdose their heart isn't working

47:31.400 --> 47:37.320
well precisely I also find it interesting that blunt trauma goes down

47:37.320 --> 47:40.360
I don't know if this this is at home so this wouldn't count for traffic

47:40.360 --> 47:44.760
accidents work injuries I guess that wouldn't be there

47:44.760 --> 47:47.720
it's it is odd the more I think about it now yeah

47:47.720 --> 47:54.760
it's down from 21 190 down to 14,550

47:54.760 --> 48:00.040
my thinking is so I'm surprised and yet can explain it like okay how would you

48:00.040 --> 48:03.560
explain it well there's so okay there's more people being

48:03.560 --> 48:07.880
attended to right because more people are at home so if you figure

48:07.880 --> 48:10.920
let's just say you live with you know the parent that you're taking care of

48:10.920 --> 48:16.840
or something like that right or your kids right the kids the kids are at home

48:16.840 --> 48:21.720
I don't know maybe just people being at home more prevents

48:21.720 --> 48:25.320
some of those accidents that normally happen

48:25.320 --> 48:28.920
maybe a lot of blunt actually here's something a little darker that I

48:29.000 --> 48:32.760
didn't think of before but maybe a lot of blunt trauma is people

48:32.760 --> 48:37.320
in nursing homes I'd be curious about that

48:37.320 --> 48:40.760
so some of these residents could be in nursing

48:40.760 --> 48:43.480
maybe there's a dry tinder effect so maybe there's a dry tinder effect

48:43.480 --> 48:47.080
if people are dead that's possible people are more prone to

48:47.080 --> 48:50.760
falling if they are you know in an advanced age or their

48:50.760 --> 48:54.120
health is uh yeah yeah that that is a that is a

48:54.120 --> 48:56.920
trigger so I find that I find that interesting

48:56.920 --> 49:02.040
um but it's really the cardiac arrest and drug calls that catch my

49:02.040 --> 49:04.760
attention the most even though in this study

49:04.760 --> 49:08.600
there you know your attention is maybe supposed to be on the volume

49:08.600 --> 49:13.000
that increase and my colleague Tom is redime pointed out to me

49:13.000 --> 49:15.480
that this was a really good insight he said you know

49:15.480 --> 49:20.120
this is a significant increase and much was made in the media about how many

49:20.120 --> 49:24.600
calls most calls they've ever had right the 911 system was overwhelmed

49:24.600 --> 49:30.200
more than 911 all of that but it's not that big of a jump

49:30.200 --> 49:34.200
I think it's something like 20 the numbers are like 25 to 30 percent

49:34.200 --> 49:38.680
overall jump I mean if you're going from 4 000 to 6 000

49:38.680 --> 49:42.280
that's a 50 percent yeah that's true that's true but

49:42.280 --> 49:47.000
it's not worthy sure yeah it's it's no it's noteworthy

49:47.000 --> 49:51.720
it doesn't match necessary it doesn't explain

49:51.720 --> 49:55.560
the massive mortality rise when you're looking at the percent

49:55.560 --> 49:59.240
increase in more in deaths overall at all places

49:59.240 --> 50:02.200
do you go back to the previous chart of numbers

50:02.200 --> 50:05.880
sure yep this one yep this isn't all calls this is

50:05.880 --> 50:09.640
this is bigger some bigger category there's other category too

50:09.640 --> 50:14.680
um so respiratory is of course up 15 percent

50:14.680 --> 50:20.040
that would correlate with a novel respiratory pathogen spreading around

50:20.040 --> 50:24.760
call more than 15 percent excuse me 15 000 right because this is deep

50:24.760 --> 50:29.160
right yeah 15 000 up 162 percent the cardiac arrest

50:29.160 --> 50:32.520
is up a higher percentage but the total number increases

50:32.520 --> 50:38.200
well 4400 right which is what what was causing it well

50:38.200 --> 50:43.000
we were told that in in China some people were just dropping dead of COVID

50:43.000 --> 50:46.360
sure i don't know if they were if their heart just stopped working because

50:46.360 --> 50:50.600
they were overwhelmed with the the SARS-CoV-2 virus

50:50.600 --> 50:55.480
uh but that increase of 4400 is well it's not quite as much as the

50:55.480 --> 51:02.360
decrease in 6300 and and uh drug use or drug overdose is

51:02.360 --> 51:06.680
accidental well remember too this is just the calls it's not the

51:06.680 --> 51:11.880
disposition right these aren't all dead people

51:11.880 --> 51:15.160
these are these are just the calls that were were made or how the calls were

51:15.320 --> 51:19.320
okay so these are the calls so this is not the

51:19.320 --> 51:22.440
disposition of the people who visit the home

51:22.440 --> 51:26.600
in response to the call this is not the assessment of the emergency response

51:26.600 --> 51:29.720
team this is the call itself is saying so

51:29.720 --> 51:34.920
no someone who made some people may speculate the call was you know uh

51:34.920 --> 51:38.760
i don't know i fell down the stairs and then but here it's showing up as a

51:38.760 --> 51:41.880
heart issue well good okay so good good question

51:41.880 --> 51:46.040
if my memory serves me in this particular study they actually don't

51:46.040 --> 51:49.880
say that the master data set the EMS incident data set

51:49.880 --> 51:54.840
does have fault so it has initial call final call

51:54.840 --> 51:58.200
right how it was classified initially and then how it was

51:58.200 --> 52:03.480
classified by EMS and then there's the dispatch code basically

52:03.480 --> 52:08.120
what happened with the patient right so those are different things

52:08.120 --> 52:11.960
if my memory serves me in this study it's not

52:11.960 --> 52:16.840
clear who if it's initial call or final

52:16.840 --> 52:20.440
call hope right like whose code we're looking at

52:20.440 --> 52:24.920
here is not clear and again i tried to get some of the data

52:24.920 --> 52:30.040
from the authors and they said no even though it's a publicly funded study

52:30.040 --> 52:33.720
even though the lead author is the chief medical officer of the fire

52:33.720 --> 52:37.400
department of new york he didn't say no exactly he said uh

52:37.400 --> 52:41.800
not at this time or so so i'm even more cryptic

52:41.800 --> 52:46.200
not i cannot i mean like something somebody would say to a senator if

52:46.200 --> 52:50.040
they were being you know soon we're gonna get right on it

52:50.040 --> 52:55.080
yeah exactly so let's look at some of these other dispatch

52:55.080 --> 52:59.240
batch codes because they give us some some insights

52:59.240 --> 53:04.360
these are ambulances transporting patient from point of pickup to somewhere

53:04.360 --> 53:07.880
else now we assume that most of these would be to hospital but

53:07.880 --> 53:13.640
not necessarily again we don't see anything much

53:13.640 --> 53:18.120
going on then we see 15 days to slow the spread

53:18.120 --> 53:26.200
is called transport stay relatively normal here

53:26.200 --> 53:30.840
and then the cares act is passed i'm just gonna i'll make another arrow so

53:30.840 --> 53:35.800
people can see the cares act is passed right here

53:35.800 --> 53:40.920
and we see transports go down but not relative to the number of calls

53:40.920 --> 53:44.280
right because calls are up here calls are up

53:44.280 --> 53:50.040
and all dispatches i should say are up but we're transporting

53:50.040 --> 53:56.200
fewer patients so if we look at all all on one graph

53:56.200 --> 54:00.280
this is emergency department visits so now

54:00.280 --> 54:03.320
necessarily people being admitted to the hospital with emergency department

54:03.320 --> 54:09.320
visits dispatches all dispatches and dispatches

54:09.320 --> 54:14.120
that are transporting patients transporting patient dispatches is that

54:14.120 --> 54:22.520
blue this transporting patients okay this is emergency department visits

54:22.520 --> 54:26.840
and then this is all ambulance dispatches so i have them all on the same

54:26.840 --> 54:31.640
axis in in this one so dispatches go up just for these three dimensions right

54:31.640 --> 54:35.160
we see emergency department visits go down

54:35.160 --> 54:41.720
dispatches go up but dispatches transporting patients go down so this

54:41.720 --> 54:47.240
dispatches transporting patients is not driving this rise

54:47.240 --> 54:50.600
right does that make sense it's not going up because more people are being

54:50.600 --> 54:55.800
taken to the hospital and in fact EMS was being told to

54:55.800 --> 54:59.880
avoid bringing people to the hospital so they're sending out more

54:59.880 --> 55:05.000
emergency responders to bring less people back

55:05.000 --> 55:09.720
basically the other disturbing thing is in late march

55:09.720 --> 55:13.720
and then specifically on april first people can look up this article if they

55:13.720 --> 55:17.320
want to this is from an EMS news site and they can look up other related

55:17.320 --> 55:23.160
articles but it was said at the time that you know there was flexibility

55:23.160 --> 55:28.840
being afforded or CMS changed some different rules and protocols

55:28.840 --> 55:37.000
because covid-19 emergency about where ambulances could take patients

55:37.000 --> 55:41.640
you know i don't i don't know CMS rules like some of these medical things i'm

55:41.640 --> 55:47.240
not i'm not an expert in other people could maybe look at them as well but

55:47.320 --> 55:54.920
even more importantly um or just as weird is the the arp the american rescue

55:54.920 --> 55:59.640
plan act that was passed in march 2021 it retroactively

55:59.640 --> 56:04.600
reimbursed ambulance providers for all events related to a covid patient

56:04.600 --> 56:11.400
even if the patient was not transporting a theory that my colleague my colleague

56:11.400 --> 56:17.320
thomas and i have is that maybe ambulance companies

56:17.320 --> 56:21.160
knew that like maybe they were given a heads up with some of these rules that

56:21.160 --> 56:25.480
hey look i'm going to direct you not to bring people to the hospital

56:25.480 --> 56:29.560
because the hospitals are over we we know EMS was told that in new york we

56:29.560 --> 56:33.960
have i have the press releases you know hospitals are overwhelmed you know

56:33.960 --> 56:37.880
please try to avoid you know spread please try to avoid bringing

56:37.960 --> 56:42.520
people to the to the hospital but ambulances were reimbursed as though they

56:42.520 --> 56:47.480
did i don't know what your thoughts are but i'm really i'm really disturbed by

56:47.480 --> 56:50.040
that so you're so everybody has focused on these

56:50.040 --> 56:57.640
incentives that the hospitals received but what i see are incentives for ambulances

56:57.640 --> 57:01.720
simultaneous to a time when there was an incredible rise

57:01.720 --> 57:06.440
in ducks at home something's not right about that

57:06.440 --> 57:10.120
i mean from an ethics standpoint no matter what

57:10.120 --> 57:17.880
then i also see in the data dispatch data what was driving

57:17.880 --> 57:23.800
no pun intended what was driving the dispatch increase

57:23.800 --> 57:29.000
it was refused medical aid refused to administrate or

57:29.000 --> 57:34.600
refused to receive that's a good question

57:34.760 --> 57:39.480
technically according to the i'll say the ambulance

57:39.480 --> 57:43.560
guides that we've looked at if we look at a state level one in a city level

57:43.560 --> 57:51.960
sort of protocol guide rma is the patient refusing medical aid of some kind

57:51.960 --> 57:57.160
being brought to the hospital or maybe some other kind of medical aid

57:57.160 --> 58:01.800
maybe put this mask on no i'm not doing that could that have been coded

58:01.800 --> 58:07.800
refused medical aid we're going to administer this

58:07.800 --> 58:12.520
medication via nebulizer no i don't want no i don't want that for my husband

58:12.520 --> 58:17.560
is that refused medical aid there's many reports at the time

58:17.560 --> 58:21.640
and these are reported in news media so again you have to kind of

58:21.640 --> 58:24.840
take some of this with a grain of salt but of

58:24.840 --> 58:29.400
ems you know saying that they hold people not to go to the hospital

58:29.400 --> 58:34.280
or or people saying that ems told them not to go to the hospital

58:34.280 --> 58:37.800
so we 15 days to slow the spread is called

58:37.800 --> 58:41.560
and this this is a dramatic rise

58:41.560 --> 58:46.440
wow so approximately five looks like around five hundred and ten

58:46.440 --> 58:52.120
a week before refused medical aid when at home

58:52.120 --> 58:54.680
at point of pickup at point of pickup

58:54.680 --> 58:57.400
so that's because it could be a homeless shelter

58:57.400 --> 59:01.720
it could be a police station so all of those things could be in the mix so

59:01.720 --> 59:05.000
it's not just the person's you know apartment on the upper east side

59:05.000 --> 59:10.760
right so or whatever bungalow and that went from very rapidly

59:10.760 --> 59:14.440
over the course of looks like three weeks about five hundred a week five

59:14.440 --> 59:21.320
hundred fifty a week to two thousand two hundred a week

59:21.320 --> 59:24.360
for a few couple weeks for a few weeks

59:24.360 --> 59:28.040
yeah i mean here here's i put them on different actions trying to think of

59:28.040 --> 59:33.240
the scenarios where that would make sense

59:33.240 --> 59:38.600
so you know that there were a lot of basic calls for just general illness

59:38.600 --> 59:42.360
right big increase in that for respiratory maybe people you know

59:42.360 --> 59:45.880
panicking right so one interpretation here

59:45.880 --> 59:50.600
is that a good number and i think we have the specific data to suggest

59:50.600 --> 59:53.400
this i'd have to go back in and look at the numbers again i get

59:53.400 --> 59:56.920
i get kind of a migraine every time i look at this specific data because the

59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.360
files are so big but there is an argument to be made for

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:04.200
there was a portion of these rma's that were worried well

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:08.520
right the ambulance shows up hey you don't really need to go to the hospital

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.440
the hospital is overwhelmed which that was alive first of all right but maybe

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.440
they were but maybe there was no reason for the person to go to the hospital

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.280
and they were coached away from it i don't know why

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:24.200
ambulances would have been sent out for somebody who's like i think i have

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.800
covid and i have a little bit of a fever why are we sending out

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:33.080
ambulances in that time when there's an emergency there's an emergency

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.440
situation i don't know why you would do that unless you were trying to just

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.440
test your system's capacity or something like that and if you have

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.480
if you know you have covid or you have some other respiratory illness you

01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:48.360
should know when you call 911 if they can't take care of you

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:53.240
on the spot you're going to go to a hospital so absolutely the expectation

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.120
on both ends is that you will have to be brought to the hospital

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.600
and if in normal times you only reverse or you only get certain reimbursements

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.120
if you bring people to the hospital then i can understand the incentive on the

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:08.520
ambulance side of it right although in this place the reverse was

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.960
happening but they ended up being reimbursed

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:17.400
anyway but that the problem is when you see also a very big rise percentage

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.040
wise in the number of people who are dead at home

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:24.760
well now we start to have some questions and also we do have the

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.720
severity codes i don't have the data in front of me

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:32.440
but we do have the severity codes for these RMA's and there's a good

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:37.880
portion or not an insignificant portion that where severity code calls one or

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.680
two which are the most severe so why is medical aid

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:48.200
being refused in calls that were coded as

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:54.760
very severe exactly if it was mild using if it was mild you can say

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:59.320
i'll take my chances at home maybe even though you already called

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:04.440
a emergency response with this general agreement that if you can't be cared

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:07.560
for at home you're going to the hospital and if you

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.920
are really sick you feel like you're going to die

01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:14.280
well the hospitals maybe they're crowded maybe they have a bunch of people with

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.560
the the deadly novel disease but you take your chances

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.520
because you're going to die anyway so well let's just let's just go to the

01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:23.320
hospital and maybe things would be better and that's

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.920
not and again that's not a case of saying no

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.080
also note that you can see this better if i had the rest of the data set on here

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:40.200
but rma stays elevated why why people so people are continuing to call

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:47.320
911 at elevated levels and receive or and refuse medical aid for those listening

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.080
who are this is audio only after it looks like

01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:57.240
march the refused medical aid rma remains elevated from

01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.840
it looks like it's around the 700 per week

01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.280
whereas previously it was about 520 a week so at 20 30 percent steady

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.760
elevation is pretty significant but that's a great question

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.400
in in my opinion this just me speaking for me

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.840
i think refused medical aid took on quite the double entendre

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:26.760
in this time who was refusing medical aid

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:34.360
we need some EMTs to start talking even if it's just on background to

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:38.920
journalists or people that they they trust when we look at some of these

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:42.280
variables all at once i i love these kind of

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.720
views i know they're distorting for a lot of people but i'm a systems

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.280
thinker you know my dad was in restaurants my

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.480
husband's in restaurants i used to work in a restaurant so i'm i'm used to

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.920
thinking about multiple things going on at one time i worked in schools too

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.960
right so i this systematic view is is uh right at my alley especially with

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.960
the timeline at the bottom but this is a macabre

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.120
i think that's the right word macabre picture

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.320
the federal government says 15 days the slow that spread

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.400
emergency department visits go down

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:21.160
hospital deaths go up first of all that's not on this that's not on this

01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:29.320
graph but they skyrocket okay people are calling for help

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:34.200
help is being dispatched fewer people are being transported

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:39.720
more medical aid is being refused and more people are dead

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:46.440
i am i again you don't have to be or consider yourself a so-called

01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:51.080
conspiracy theorist to say this warrants explanation and right now

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:54.440
the official explanation as far as i've been able to tell

01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:00.360
is covid which i think has an an alternate meaning but

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:06.200
covid and people staying awake people being afraid to go to the hospital

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:11.480
i think these didn't contradict that again um i showed the numbers before

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:18.280
uh we uh they uh there's a a perception that the uh elevated

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:21.480
that these tens of thousands of extra deaths

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:26.760
people dying of covid are being given new types of medication

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:29.720
that a high percentage of them are in hospital they're in a bed somewhere

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:35.480
they're on event and so on i still am biased to think that

01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:40.120
most of the people who were claimed to have died of covid in New York City

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.400
went on event what was the number what was the percentage that

01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:47.960
did not according to these records according to this data

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.080
die on a ventilator or die in a hospital setting

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:54.120
none of none of these were you mean the pronounced dead

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:57.080
none of them would have died out of ventilator what was that number again

01:05:57.080 --> 01:06:01.720
what was like the number of excess deaths not hospital

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.720
uh you mean the increase where did i have it's about five five

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:09.800
the the increase i think is five thousand six thousand does that sound about

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:13.640
right uh yeah i'll buy that so out of the overall

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.320
increase of twenty five thousand here's the age group so i don't i don't have

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.880
the youngest age groups on here but there's not

01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:24.920
they don't form the bulk of increases anyway in this period so

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:29.000
five thousand almost six almost six thousand

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:34.200
so if someone is is thinking that um you know the

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:39.000
twenty five thousand excess deaths approximately in a month

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:43.400
that most of those people were in a bed on event in a hospital

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:47.720
that's not true uh six thousand approximately

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.080
it increased number of deaths were not at a hospital

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.440
they're at a point of where the person made the call at home

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:59.960
again police station part outside etc shelter and so on

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:03.000
and actually if you want to look at on a graph

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.400
if you want to see these are two different data sources

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:12.520
but black is patient pronounced dead at point of pickup

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:19.720
and then red are deaths at home now in the baseline in normal times

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:25.720
if we consider this period normal deaths at home are more than

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.160
patient pronounced dead

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:32.840
it's weird that these things rise simultaneously i don't know maybe

01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:36.680
it's not i don't know i have a lot of questions about this

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:43.720
but we see a reversal for a time for about six weeks we see a

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:50.600
reversal where patient pronounced dead exceeds deaths at home

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:54.840
how do we explain that well i don't know that this is simple but

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:59.240
because when you're being picked up somewhere or when 911 is called in the

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:02.200
ambulance it comes against you it's not always at your home

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.040
or the you know the dwelling classified as your home

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.280
we can infer that a lot of these patients pronounced dead were

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:13.400
dead somewhere other than a place that was classified

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.960
than their home but they're supposed to be home

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.360
that's weird this is the slow the spread time you're supposed to be home

01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.840
maybe this means that there were ambulances called to nursing homes

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:28.040
because in this data said nursing home at least a skilled nursing home should

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:31.240
be in a different in a different place of death

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.600
well perhaps a nursing home versus an elderly

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.760
residence yeah there's some there's some

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:42.600
yeah nursing home and long-term care facility

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:47.320
is a distinct category in place of death in both the city data and cdc

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:51.560
wonder then decidence home okay but they don't but they don't have

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:55.640
exactly the same definition and there's some will go room

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:58.120
i know i you know whose voices in my mind right now is

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:01.880
Andrew Cuomo's um one of the things that he said

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:05.240
you i read all the things i read all the things

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.600
but you have to you have you have to you have to you have to read this stuff

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:12.520
you know it's propaganda right yeah but i encourage people all the time

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.320
you you read wikipedia you read the propaganda

01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.160
you will find inconsistencies and it's always interesting as to when

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:23.160
their statement was one thing on one day and then it changes on another day

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:26.200
put it on a map yes you have to go through it that way

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.200
remember when he said who cares where people died

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:35.320
they died he's yelling at a a media person i don't remember that but i could

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.880
but i could see i could see him saying that

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:42.840
the great clip and that was in 2021 when he i think when he was being accused

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.440
of you know covering up you know nursing home deaths which well we'll have to

01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.160
talk about that sometime that that whole thing is

01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.880
a different kind of a or a ruse but this is still disturbing like the

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:57.320
comparison here it's like well where were people dying

01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:01.480
if not at places that were classified as their home

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:05.960
hotels is homeless shelter considered your home

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:09.320
is prison considered your home i mean right we could start to get

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:15.480
sort of dark here central park anybody like i find that interesting

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:19.960
but with the cardiac arrests you know we can look at

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:26.840
that dispatch data by call type so if when you look at pronounce dead

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:33.480
cardiac arrest nothing is going on leading up to

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:37.240
the slow the spread decree sorry that it should be more right here

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.920
right i should move this over right and then we see this

01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:52.120
we see this massive rise so what was triggering cardiac arrests

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:56.520
if i may i have a rec a document here this is a paper from

01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:00.760
2022 substance abuse journal i presumably

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.200
drug overdoses leading cause of injury related to the united states we know

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:08.200
that it has been linked predominantly to respiratory depression

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.240
and cardiac toxicity both of which can lead to

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:16.520
cardiac arrest so uh you know respiratory issues

01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:21.000
your heart is working well the week um respiratory

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:27.480
minus asthma is up 162 percent cardiopulmonary arrest as you shown

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:32.840
is other cardiac also up 223 percent it's like

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:38.680
drug down and drug overdoses were uh oddly down

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:43.640
or not not up much drug overdose deaths in this period not up much

01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:47.320
yeah it's it's not it's not what people would

01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:51.880
assume i think i already showed that we're showing here um this is the call

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.920
type you're showing that for the call type again these aren't deaths necessary

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.000
but the call type for drug overdoses was down

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.920
well here's deaths so i don't have drug overdoses broken out here

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.200
accidental or otherwise i can i can do that and send it to you

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.880
but i do have just external causes right so external causes

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:16.360
i'm sorry this is hard to see but external causes is the green line

01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:21.560
and that's where drug would be or is that's the category that drug is in

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:25.560
so there there is you know if we only had drug in here or external you see that

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:28.440
there is a little bit of a rise it actually doesn't come into later

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.880
though until later may

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.240
so so this idea uh and and that does reflect the national trend too

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:41.400
right wasn't there also nationally may is really the month

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:48.040
when the overdoses went up the yeah it was may um i don't know national

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.440
of mayor june it started to say the death classified is overdose

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.440
i mean i did videos in 2021 or deer was just

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.840
uh oh no i know because i was about it too

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:03.080
well my son was in uh uh you know uh sober living facilities

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:08.120
and they were that the turnover was unprecedented

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:14.520
there were so many people dying it was off the charts

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.720
this document that i'm reviewing the association of cardiac arrest with

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:22.840
opioid overdose well actually it even it called intransport

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.120
um that wasn't a statement that these were

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:31.960
drug order's deaths okay that's that's a statement that

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:38.360
the symptoms that you're showing surging uh respiratory and cardiopulmonary

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:42.680
issues are the two things which most correspond

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:48.120
with an opioid overdose that that was uh now it something else could be

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:51.480
causing them deadly novel virus for example

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.800
it is what is it is a strong alignment and with the calls

01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:01.960
that were stated to be related to drug overdoses down

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.800
it's again it doesn't match perfectly but

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.040
someone should be wanting to ask these questions

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:14.600
right if the interpretation of everything that happened in new york

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:19.480
city in nationally 2021 was that there was a

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:23.000
deadly novel virus that's going to kill you know two percent

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.480
twenty percent i don't know the population

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:31.000
and it's unstoppable unless we have a brand new type of medical intervention

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:35.720
introduced okay well that would mean that

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:39.720
how every injury everything that happens with respect to the medical

01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.680
intervention is happening only because of

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.840
the assessment of these events so

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:51.400
if we want to address the potential risks

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:54.200
i'm not going to say they do or don't exist

01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.720
people know what i actually think though of the interventions

01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:01.320
why not just go straight to the underlying events

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.120
and and make sure that we have interpreted those

01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:07.720
properly and there are armies of people that are

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:11.960
heavily funded touring the world talking about the risks of these

01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:15.800
medical interventions that do not want the world to know about

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.080
Jessica they don't want to talk about new york city

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.920
one of those one of those people told me recently

01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:27.320
that he didn't think that new york city hospitals needed to be investigated

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:32.520
if only on the basis of the young deaths that occurred there alone

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:35.960
so i don't you know i i can't tell him what to think

01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.800
even though he says he was there and he saw young people dying

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:44.200
fathers taxi cab drivers truck drivers he said

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:48.840
he doesn't think they need to be that needs to be investigated

01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:52.120
what i was going to ask you is because you know better than i do

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:57.160
you know unfortunately is what is the difference between a drug overdose

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.800
and a drug poisoning i mean ultimately an overdose is a poisoning

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:06.760
right chemically speaking you know how do you know if people overdose on a

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:11.480
drug or were poisoned by a drug a medication perhaps i should have more

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:14.760
detailed knowledge of uh you know death codes and stuff like that i

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:18.600
don't it's not an area that ever really this is the question i've been putting

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.360
out um if uh if a child were to say get into the

01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.000
parents on lock medicine cabinet or drink some antifreeze

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.400
something like this you know uh that's that's a poisoning uh if you're

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:36.120
dealing with a an overdose it's a it is a poisoning now

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.200
there may be immediate responses to let's say the cardiac issue

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:43.480
although the way that these things are treated

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.040
should take into account the potential reason of the cardiac event if someone

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.320
is likely to have overdosed on let's say someone had fentanyl exposure

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:56.600
there are some interventions which have a

01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:02.040
higher likelihood of you know reviving them if administered at a proper time

01:17:02.040 --> 01:17:05.080
i mean it would it we would expect that during this

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:09.000
period that we would see an increase in autopsies and deaths that occur at

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:14.280
home right but you know instead that's actually not

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:19.240
what we see we see according to cdc wonder

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.800
you can look at deaths you know and and whether the three options are

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.160
autopsy yes autopsy no or autopsy unknown

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:34.680
so in this period for deaths at home specifically in new york city

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:39.560
not in chicago by the way but in new york city

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:47.960
we see a drop in autopsies conducted for deaths at home

01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:52.120
and you know it was reported in the news at the time too that the that the

01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:56.440
medical examiner was so overwhelmed actually the medical examiner's office

01:17:56.440 --> 01:18:01.880
was so overwhelmed by the bodies and the deaths at home were so

01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.880
overwhelming mark that the national guard was brought in

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.440
to remove bodies from homes well i heard i heard about the freezer

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.520
trucks bodies no no yeah that's freezer trucks yeah

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.960
how is uh a doctor paul kachel md um who were there we'll have to talk about

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.760
the trucks at different time i'm still waiting for uh

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:28.360
data back from fema about the trucks that they assisted the 85 d o d trucks that

01:18:28.440 --> 01:18:32.600
they assisted reported leaves still waiting for the manifests

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:37.960
and the other data that i requested they've delayed that response a lot

01:18:37.960 --> 01:18:42.200
they actually referred it to somebody from uh i guess somebody from deloitte

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:46.680
who works with fema is working on my request for that i think that's strange

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.480
let's talk about that another time but but why why is there a drop so

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:57.640
so the biggest home death event in new york city i mean in recent history

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.240
right i know there's been trends over time and you know whether people die at

01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.920
the hospital or at home right so i'm not talking about the 1800s right

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:12.360
but certainly in the past 50 years biggest home death event ever

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.840
right far more than chicago and you know it's funny mark

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:20.360
in chicago the medical examiner you can see

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:25.320
every death that they that they process every single one

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.680
is public automatically has this always been the case in

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:31.720
new york city or was there a change made in the last

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:35.640
or is there a notable change in the way that the data is made available in

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:37.880
new york city i you know i don't know i don't think

01:19:37.880 --> 01:19:42.440
death certificates necessarily have ever been um

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:47.480
obtainable via foya you can see a group called i think it's a group the group

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:52.600
reclaim the records has fought new york city on death certificates historical

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:58.120
ones and so there is you can get up to and i've looked through these actually

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.000
for in 1918 but you can you can get them through like 1949

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.080
or something like that but really there's no reason that that death records

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:11.560
death certificates in particular they're vital records and we elect an

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.800
appoint officials to steward these records they do

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:20.360
not have the right to privatize them i should be able to get and actually in

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:24.520
my county i can and i have in in Illinois i can get any i have to pay

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.280
but i can get any autopsy that i want actually my medical examiner lives down

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.920
the street yeah i mean i understand people have the

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:34.360
right to privacy i don't know why uh someone do not

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:38.840
a dead do not you're dead so i'm not talking about somebody's medical

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:42.360
record i understand i understand i'm just trying to think of

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:46.360
uh of i i don't know i mean there's always this is

01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.760
perhaps there's an interpretation maybe someone

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:52.520
the the family doesn't want to know that there was a suicide committed

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:56.520
i could see maybe there are situations where people wouldn't want

01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:00.520
uh said information to be out there but for the most

01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:05.000
part especially because making that such data available could be

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.320
critical in identifying an incompetent doctor for example

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.880
or permit government malfeasance forms

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.760
government malfeasance well and it can you can have

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:17.960
exception right but the default should be

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:21.240
i mean so the cook county medical examiner the ones that are automatically

01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:26.120
uploaded that i could see every every day the names are removed

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.560
but but i could still get every single one with the name on it if i want it i

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:32.200
would just have to pay the fee but in New York

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.760
it's all privatized so i mean i've said many times i don't mind saying this on

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:40.040
your your show either i i believe that New York City

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:43.240
was used to stage sudden spread of a dot

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:48.920
novel deadly respiratory pathogen and used to justify a pandemic declaration

01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:53.320
and show people that a shot was needed okay this is exhibit exhibit A

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:57.000
in this so the government has made a claim about the number of people that

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.600
have died said that most of them died from from a coronavirus

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.640
and hasn't been forced to prove it in any way

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:08.680
including just a list of names and look they're not the medical examiner

01:22:08.680 --> 01:22:13.160
did not perform the normal number of autopsies let alone a number of autopsies

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:18.040
that is commensurate with the event that that occurred and we have no explanation

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:21.320
for this this is a publicly funded office

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:26.440
where is a root cause analysis where is there report on what happened here

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:31.960
so that we can all learn from it so we're showing this black line here is uh

01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.000
those are deaths at home those are the deaths at home

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.680
i'm sorry the purple i'm sorry the purple is that said phone these are treating

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.160
scales purple is deaths at home which goes up

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:44.920
dramatically during this month that no one wants to talk about

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:50.280
in New York City goes up dramatically and at the same time it perfectly

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:56.520
correlates with a 80 to 90 drop in home deaths which have been

01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:02.520
autopsies if anything if it stayed at the same rate whatever that is

01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:09.320
should have gone up or at least not well if it's at the same rate

01:23:09.320 --> 01:23:13.640
it's the same rate it goes up if it's the same rate it goes up

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.080
maybe that maybe there's only one person that can do it in the whole city for

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:21.560
example and that person is already really working at capacity

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.600
right because they only plan for a certain number of deaths every week and

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:28.360
maybe it can't go up because there's a bottleneck okay i'll give you that

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:35.320
much but it actually goes down and the national guard was helping them

01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:39.080
not and there's no i mean i'm obviously fired up by there's no excuse for this

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.800
no there's no excuse for people ignoring it

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:45.960
either i you know i get it i'm a nobody right what does she know but

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.600
this is this is pretty clear anybody can look at this this data

01:23:50.600 --> 01:23:55.000
what explanation have people provided for this there's no resistance there's

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.560
what i would call dynamic silence right like who who said that whose

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:03.640
concept is that the dynamic silence so it's like we're going to

01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:09.720
actively ignore this right we're not going to respond to it

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:14.440
either way that that's what i that's what i face

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:17.800
mostly now it doesn't mean again maybe people just aren't paying attention to

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:20.840
me people have moved on to other things people are people are in romania

01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.960
right health freedom advocates are in romania

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.960
you know they're they're uh they're testified to ron johnson

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:31.080
they've got they've got bigger they've got better things to do what do they

01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.960
care about new york who cares about new york

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.120
i'm just a historian here i'm i'm just uh i'm just a historian

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:42.920
so i don't know i i i think i think this i think rfk should be

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:46.280
interested in this and i don't care what rfk does i'm not

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.560
you know i'm probably voting libertarian by the way but

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:53.560
they should all be candidates but yeah everybody should be interested

01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:57.720
in this right well i'm not down the trump he was

01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.200
president during this time he's from new york

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:05.240
so is vouchy so is promo that's true media capital of the world where's

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:08.120
al experiencing

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:13.480
anyway speaking of the you know i've i've mentioned a few times the ems

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:17.560
orders i have a whole pdf file that goes along with this we composed it

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.160
people can look through it um i've gone back and forth on the

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:25.800
implications of these orders i think it's interesting

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:33.240
that on march first fdny took certified first responders

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:37.720
off of any calls that would be considered

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.680
coronavirus related like asthma fever cough so low grade

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:47.960
so it's interesting that at march first coronavirus was considered

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.360
low grade call not worthy of you know putting cfr

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:57.400
on on those march first was the day that the the first new york city case

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:02.120
was announced a woman health care worker who had come back from i ran

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:06.840
where 12 officials were killed by the coronavirus

01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:13.160
and um they were refocused primarily to cardiac arrest calls

01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:20.360
two weeks before 15 days to slow the spread was announced

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:26.360
10 days before the who declared a pandemic

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:30.040
i mean there might be some good explanations for that

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:33.800
maybe it was anticipated that there would be more cardiac arrest calls

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:37.560
or that there would be more panicked people calling

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:42.440
and we shouldn't we shouldn't take cfr off of cardiac arrest or we shouldn't

01:26:42.440 --> 01:26:49.880
do anything that would you know deprioritize cardiac arrest

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.320
and then there's a series of different orders that are given and guidelines

01:26:55.320 --> 01:27:01.640
that are given to emps about some relate to putting masks on

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:06.760
patients including patients in cardiac arrest way to ways to um

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:12.280
man airway management what to do and what not to do to prevent spread

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.760
um there was a temporary lowering of disaster staffing standards i can't

01:27:16.760 --> 01:27:20.520
remember what the number is like reducing it from like three people to two or

01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.280
two to one i can't remember what the ratio was off the top of my head right now

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:30.520
so we're uh putting you know more or fewer people in an ambulance

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:36.440
fewer emps fewer witnesses maybe it's the way that i'm starting to think of it

01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.280
there were some cardiac arrest standards that were put into place that were

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:43.720
you know you read them and you read the press releases related to them and

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:49.160
you're like they were basically telling them to not do what they normally do

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.600
for cardiac arrest why were there so many cardiac arrests

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.120
at this time and why are you telling them not to do something

01:27:56.120 --> 01:28:01.240
with those people there was what could be interpreted as or what i

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.560
interpret as basically a cardiac arrest dnr order

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.080
although the orders that preceded it i think could sort of be

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.080
interpreted that way as well but it's funny because when you

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:17.800
line up the timeline of the orders it doesn't

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:23.080
quite line up with the trajectory here

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.360
i have a question go go ahead uh during this time

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.880
and i know you don't have any uh quantifiable data on this

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:41.080
but has anyone shared a story uh or any type of anecdotal information

01:28:41.080 --> 01:28:46.840
which would suggest that there were new first responder staffing or first

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.320
responder services introduced in New York City during this month

01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.520
well so i believe it's april first

01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:02.360
that um there were a bunch of ambulances that came in from out of state they

01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.440
were female like like ambulances and first be right

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.400
from out of state what what's the military doing doing during this time

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:15.400
who is driving these ambulances i mean let let me

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.240
since you know i don't care i i told you before i like i like to speculate i

01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:24.120
i've speculated to this to some of my my colleagues are all of these calls

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:28.440
real that's what i want to know are all of these calls

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:33.800
real are any of these calls simulated i think that's a reasonable question to

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:37.080
ask oh it would be very easy to simulate these

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:41.640
of course it would be and and we know the military descended on new york at

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.000
this time although it's funny if you read you know we

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:49.400
we've got the comfort coming in right i mean

01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:52.920
were there i i said this before it's crazy to think about this but like

01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:57.240
were their bodies already on the comfort did the comfort bring some bodies into

01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:00.200
the city that that's nuts right that's nuts

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.800
but that that's that's the kind of thing that when you go back and you look

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:09.160
half the staff got off the comfort and we're staying in the city

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:14.520
i we why why did they stay on the boat i i inter because because of social

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:17.240
distancing that was that that was what the press

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:22.120
release has said so they so wait they had staff on the boat

01:30:22.120 --> 01:30:28.840
it is a big boat they needed to go to a hotel so they had more distance

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.680
what so they needed to what go to a hotel so they can have more distance i

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.240
mean right but right we're going to take half of them off

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:38.760
so that we can accommodate social distancing

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:42.280
that's what that's what the u.s may they said in their in their media

01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:47.080
release a doctor that i interviewed along with

01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:51.080
martinneal and jonathan angler we posted his his story

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.560
we called him phro but we posted his story on

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:59.560
on sub stack um he saw he saw military in his hospital

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:04.600
in the covid icu awards has anyone picked up on any identifying

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:09.880
information emblems any anything that was unique about the uniform and you

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.360
can you don't have to share it with now well i mean

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.640
and so phro referred to them as naval health officers

01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:18.680
if i'm not mistaken you have to i just go back and look at our sorry i can't

01:31:18.680 --> 01:31:22.120
always keep all my details in my bed at head it was i

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:26.680
i s p r cori if he saw it could as you know p here cori was in new york city

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.560
of course uh arrived after ex post facto of the main event

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:37.240
april 27th 2020 he says death is real hospital in the lower east side of

01:31:37.240 --> 01:31:42.600
manhattan i asked him if he saw military at his hospital he said no

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.400
i have no reason to disbelieve him by the way

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:49.240
so maybe the military was in some hospitals not others

01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:53.160
we know there's national guard press releases about teams you know from the

01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:57.160
national guard that were at almhurst hospital

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:02.280
i i don't know what the flip was going on um but you know it's it's all been

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:07.080
covered up in in in covid you know and i i have to

01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:11.720
you know i have to ask what with these orders

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:19.640
why were these orders given i mean and why don't they line up with the data

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:24.360
has the data been moved around again i hate to say that but after looking at

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:30.040
this for so long i i don't have a lot of explanations

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:35.320
if we look at data this is going back to january 1st 2020

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:41.880
i mean if i i have an article from march 24th 2020 from the morgan city daily

01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:47.240
review louisiana uh that says the pentagons defense

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.880
threat reduction agency dtra or ditra it was the coordinating mill it has been

01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:55.720
coordinating military flights to pick up test swab kits and distribute to various

01:32:55.720 --> 01:33:01.320
cities in the united states so yeah the military had a

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:06.040
role here uh i don't know about the other agencies

01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:08.360
i know some of the research that darp has done

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.560
uh but this is the this evidence a very specific group

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:15.480
doing a very specific thing again it's a newspaper article

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:19.560
you have to take it for what it's worth but uh i don't see why anyone would just

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.840
you know some guy out louisiana would make a story like that that's very

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:27.160
specific well the the military as you know i think

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:31.560
some people forget but the military follows orders

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:35.800
right then they're not sitting there coming up with their own plans

01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:40.360
so you know at the very least it it wasn't just one it looks at new york

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:46.440
national guard the the navy the army like we we have a new york is very

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:53.880
geographically you know geographically i mean if we look at new

01:33:53.960 --> 01:33:59.880
city uh you know you you could have i mean imagine the

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:09.240
routes in to this city that the military could take i mean this is

01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:16.360
yes it's ideal i know it's absolutely i i deal it's all aside from the Bronx it's

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:20.120
all on islands and and the Bronx is a peninsula

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:25.080
so i mean this is one of the easiest cities this port's all over the place

01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:29.160
there's no other city quite like it in the united states

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:34.200
in many in many ways in many ways and so you know these orders i've talked about

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.680
them we'll we'll post them but you know they don't match the

01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:42.920
trajectory exactly and so you have to wonder if the orders themselves were

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.920
cover for what was really going on and they don't answer the question of what

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:51.880
was motivating what was causing these cardiac arrests at home

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.040
or at point of pickup right we don't know that these are all at people's homes

01:34:56.040 --> 01:34:59.640
you know we also see if i look at patient pronounced dead cardiac arrest so

01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.480
that's a black line and then i look at transporting patient

01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:07.320
cardiac or cardiac with breathing problems

01:35:07.320 --> 01:35:13.560
okay we see a sudden surge it's slight right but we do see

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.520
with the transporting patient we do see that some cardiac people were

01:35:18.520 --> 01:35:24.200
transporting right which i know my focus in this

01:35:24.200 --> 01:35:27.240
show has been the home deaths but when i think about

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:31.480
those first two weeks or the last two weeks in march

01:35:31.480 --> 01:35:35.480
where you know we have like we're overwhelmed we have kalene smith you

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.040
know talking to the new york times about how

01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:42.760
there's not enough ventilators people are coming in from all over the place

01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:48.600
even though ed visits were down you have to wonder if there was

01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:55.240
you know initially some cardiac patients that were brought to the hospital

01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.880
and then why that stops and what function that served

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:05.960
whose narrative that served what that helps to hide was going on

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:11.320
it's it's really disturbing i mean the last piece of data i've shown so much

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:14.680
data but the last thing i want to show you was actually a study that i

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:18.440
discovered not that long ago i maybe had read it a while ago but then you

01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:22.920
come back to it very soon after the spring event

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:27.720
um a study was submitted i think it was submitted in jr.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:32.040
july and then it was published in jama cardiology in october 2020

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.240
characteristics associated with out of hospital cardiac arrests and

01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:38.360
resuscitations during the novel coronavirus disease

01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:43.000
2019 pandemic in new york city i have a lot of questions about that title

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:47.000
but um and then we've got you know fdny and

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.400
various medical medical school people on this on this study

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.320
people can read the whole study if they want to but um i tend to try to focus

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:59.400
on the things in the study that are trying to that give me a sense of what

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:02.360
happened or what they're saying happened you know

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.000
separating the wheat from the chaff so to speak

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.040
this is my table of data that's in the study

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:14.200
but we see so they they too in this study reported that increase in

01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:18.760
in arrest calls there's a slightly different time period

01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:23.240
so the data doesn't match up exactly the numbers don't match up exactly

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:29.320
but look at this mark they in this study report

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:33.160
patient dead on arrival no resuscitation was given

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.600
because the patient was dead

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:42.760
look at that increase now that in the study they kind of focus on like well

01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:47.480
it was the same you know similar proportions as normal

01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.320
you know with people who did and didn't receive resuscitation but look at the

01:37:51.320 --> 01:38:00.520
raw number why were there over 2 000 dead people

01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:07.160
on arrival who received no resuscitation over the the year before

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:12.520
i don't get it i don't get it then look at this number of resuscitation

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:15.000
given could then terminate it in the field

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:18.680
question um have you have any evidence or any

01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.080
information about response times were they up dramatically

01:38:23.080 --> 01:38:26.760
okay great great question so when you look at response times in that other

01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:32.200
study there's reason we tonda verdine actually did a great job

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:35.480
going through that being like well look you know the response times here like

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:38.600
there's more dispatches so you know it did

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.920
increase the response to the cardiac calls overall i think is what we

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:47.240
determined so you know couple of minutes or so

01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:50.680
that could make a difference but in this study

01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:55.400
they're focused just on cardiac arrest and there really isn't a difference

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:59.160
in the in the period i want to say it's like 30 30 seconds or something like

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:01.640
that it's it's negligible i don't know what an average

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:04.200
response is but let's say it goes from 30 minutes to

01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.320
an hour and a half well it's way less than that it's way

01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:12.440
but if it did then people who are are dealing with a

01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:19.560
cardiac issue from either a drug overdose or some other stress

01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:25.560
age could be one um i would see that uh the the

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:28.760
likelihood of being able to revive a person after that period time would be

01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:31.800
much less that's one example a couple minutes

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:38.840
no no that doesn't impact things uh dramatically so that is a very very

01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:43.080
big well look at how many people look at the increase even just the overall

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:46.040
raw increase and then the number of people who who

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:49.080
died it's like what is going going on here

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.120
and it's still in this study is blamed on

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:56.120
you know Covid health health care avoidance it just it doesn't

01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:01.160
it doesn't work there is a little bit of data in this study on medications

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.240
given and i might have i might have emailed this to you

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:09.320
but there is i did notice that there is a decrease in that

01:40:09.320 --> 01:40:14.520
opioid overdose drug given they report some numbers for that

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.960
in this study uh yeah in our case numbers

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:21.080
but it's they and they don't i'm like i want to see all the medications not

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.880
just the one they selected for this this study but i thought

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.400
i thought that was really interesting here's another finding from this

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.920
study and i can probably wrap up but during the Covid-19 period

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.880
which okay can we just pause there for a second

01:40:35.880 --> 01:40:39.560
all right what does this mean they're talking about

01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:44.920
like a six seven-week period they're calling it the Covid-19 period

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:49.800
that sounds like a drill to me but during the Covid-19 period out of hospital

01:40:49.800 --> 01:40:53.240
cardiac arrest were 3.5 times more likely to

01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:57.160
present in a systole and twice is likely to present

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:02.920
impulseless electrical activity than in ventricular rhythms

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.920
so i'm not a doctor but i looked up what this means actually Thomas drew my

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.720
attention to this and then i looked up what this means i was like

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.520
uh then i asked my i asked my sister's a doctor

01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.680
i didn't show her the study i just said hey when i say

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:21.000
a systole what do you think of she's like well technically

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.880
you know everybody experiences a systole because you know you're dead

01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:26.920
your heart stops i'm like i know but just as a kind

01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:32.120
of cardiac arrest she's like lightning strike

01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:36.280
i said what about drugs she's like oh yeah cocaine

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:42.760
so i think that's interesting i think that i think that's that's

01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.320
interesting well uh you probably showed this data as well

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:53.640
um already but to review was there a similar surge in cardiac

01:41:53.640 --> 01:42:00.280
events in hospitals okay so i i do because if covid is causing

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:04.920
heart failure why should it cause more heart failure at home than in the

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.440
hospital well so hospital inpatient for sure i can

01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:11.960
break down the ed separately but hospital inpatient for sure

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:17.400
almost a hundred percent of the increase is blamed on covid

01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:21.960
so i mean what what does you and i talked about this before but yeah but

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:26.840
i understand it's blamed on covid but uh in hospitals is there more

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:31.800
cardiovascular issues you're right well i don't i don't have that data

01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:35.000
i don't i don't know where i would find it right how many i mean no because

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:39.560
they're being left at home right so heart deaths

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:45.240
just even within the the heart death chapter in hospitals

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.560
did not i'll go back and check well if someone dies of i'll increase with

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.440
blamed on covid i mean underlying cause anyway okay if

01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:58.280
covid is causing the heart failure right um i guess it could cause it gradually

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.840
so you slowly get more sick you feel ill you get more winded more exhausted

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:08.040
right or you just die right it just you're you're going

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:11.800
along living your you know day is the day and the covid just

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:16.680
kills you you keel over you know fall into the water

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.640
now if that's the characteristic of covid right

01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:24.200
if you are in the hospital and if it's the instant death from covid

01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.800
it doesn't matter if someone is there holding your hand

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:30.920
you're just going to croak

01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:35.080
or if it behaves the same way or if it's a gradual thing

01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:39.800
right then why would people at home are slowly getting more and more sick

01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:44.040
wait until they're dying of a heart attack before they call

01:43:44.040 --> 01:43:48.280
they they were calling they they were calling they were calling but that means

01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:51.560
that they were calling before they had the heart issue they're like i'm feeling

01:43:51.560 --> 01:43:54.120
we're in a bystander when we did uh boy yeah

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:59.720
before i can't hold out my food this so there's there's inconsistencies here

01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:04.920
right it should behave the same way at home as it does in a hospital

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:09.560
so it's almost like maybe there was only a diff maybe there was um

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:13.960
what they call a mutation of the virus that existed in homes

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:18.680
it didn't like the cross hospital you know boys and i say this jokingly

01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:26.280
because i'm i'm actually mocking the lack of uh of inquisition out there

01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.880
i'm uh you know does these narratives don't

01:44:29.880 --> 01:44:34.200
make sense they are completely incongruent

01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:39.160
i here here's my theory here's my current theory but i could change my mind

01:44:39.160 --> 01:44:45.160
perhaps there was a strategic controlled

01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:50.760
drug poisoning event imagine how easy that would be

01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:57.240
oh it would be very easy and you can you can have very very convincing

01:44:57.240 --> 01:45:03.240
repressed pills um all you need is a few locations to distribute uh i don't

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:07.560
know um uh you know anti-anxiety medicines zanax

01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:11.640
uh you know with fentanyl installed all you two pharmacists

01:45:11.640 --> 01:45:15.880
you could poison several thousand people very very easily it doesn't need to be

01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:21.720
a lot and i've i've seen these pills i've seen the lethal pills well

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:26.440
unfortunately i've had i don't know personally these uh these kids but

01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.720
i do know of two children in boston that died

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.160
teenagers not even drug addicts they call these one and done

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.200
you go to a party you know you're being a stupid teenager

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:40.760
hey uh so and so has some zanax pills oh i heard that makes you feel this way

01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.200
and you know it's laced with the lethal level of fentanyl

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:49.560
this stuff is out there uh and oh by the way we did just have a drug epidemic

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:53.800
of five hundred thousand deaths in five years

01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:57.480
five hundred thousand in five years a hundred thousand a year

01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:00.760
average in the year two thousand was a little over twenty thousand

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:07.720
um which is the main contributor of the uh of the life expectancy drops

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:11.000
it started the life expectancy drop in 2019

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.440
uh and it's only gotten worse since then and if

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.680
and if that inquisition would lead to a different assessment of what happened

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.960
in new york city and completely undermine the uh the uh impetus

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:29.960
to roll out all of the mRNA vaccines why will nobody do it

01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:34.040
why won't anyone even consider the possibility

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.840
if the fact if these these interventions are

01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:41.320
causing so much harm and death why not spend a couple of days

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:45.560
at least rule it out see everything in new york there's

01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:49.560
the on stage version of what's going on

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.360
actually there's the op and the counter op which are launched at the same time

01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:57.560
ventilators is a great example we need ventilators we need ventilators

01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:01.400
oh wait the ventilators they're shutting down the car factories to make ventilators

01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:04.200
they were just rolling off the forward plant

01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:07.400
ventilators right away was the counter op don't you remember

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:10.680
holly and smith was yelling about ventilators so was quomo

01:47:10.680 --> 01:47:15.560
and then march 31st cam and kyle sidel puts a youtube video out that never

01:47:15.560 --> 01:47:19.880
got taken down and he was venerated and promoted

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:25.320
by webnd and the new york times and his his i'm just sitting here in my

01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:27.960
apartment the ventilators don't appear be able to

01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.080
working oh you had this hospital garban

01:47:31.080 --> 01:47:35.560
same up ventilators in my opinion work cover

01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:40.760
for the drugs because what kills the fastest in a medical setting

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:46.680
not a ventilator it's an injection and maybe they injected people who were

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:50.520
already in the hospital and were on the precipice

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:54.760
i mean this is dark stuff but we don't have answers

01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.640
nobody wants to talk about it why was cfr placed primarily on cardiac arrest

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.080
calls the same day the first covid case was announced

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:06.840
what does covid mean is it the name of an operation

01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:09.880
it's poppin it's poppin it's poppin

01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:14.120
exactly what do these things mean was there

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:21.800
uh i'll go with a poisoning event drugs very very easy to control i dare say

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.400
that some people some agencies have some experience

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:30.040
with this maybe from in in the so i've heard so it's been documented by

01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:34.520
to trigger it and maybe that's the explanation for there were young people

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:38.120
showing up to the hospital not being not able to breathe

01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:44.040
they were hypoxic were they injected were i mean the other possibilities were

01:48:44.040 --> 01:48:47.800
homeless people picked up off the streets and injected with sedatives

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.440
to calm them down in the in the ambulance

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.840
i mean that this again very very dark

01:48:56.840 --> 01:49:01.560
or maybe maybe all this maybe this is fabricated

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.560
maybe this is deaths pushed from here and pushed from here

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.400
into a maybe their models got away from them

01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.800
and they actually use deaths to catch up with the model

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.920
so some of these things that i'm saying i i'm not representing the perspectives

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:20.840
of other people or colleagues or whatever people that i've

01:49:20.840 --> 01:49:24.680
worked with this is you know things like that or

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:29.320
my speculations about what what could have been going on

01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:35.560
are my own and in a lot of cases i keep getting more data back and looking

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.200
and you know i could be completely wrong

01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:43.320
okay those sound like extreme theories they sound like extreme how could that

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:47.160
happen well millions of people are now being told

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:51.640
what really happened was right there's an overweight

01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:55.320
virologist at the university north carolina

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:59.480
that wanted to make an extra few dollars on patents

01:49:59.480 --> 01:50:05.720
so he decided to unleash again a function virus on the planet

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:09.400
while working with a researcher who was affectionate of bats

01:50:09.400 --> 01:50:12.760
in china and killed 15 million people

01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:17.720
i mean that's the current narrative and this guy is he's a really bad dude

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.920
very very careless that's the narrative right now

01:50:20.920 --> 01:50:24.440
and that's all you need to know we will arrest him and uh it's done

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:27.640
you know by the way all cancer therapy and matter of fact all

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:30.600
immunizations going forward are now gene therapy oh by the way

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.640
just happens to be the one thing that the united states has more invested in

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.120
probably our entire space program was the hiv vaccine

01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:41.720
and even even our space program was mostly studying cancers

01:50:41.720 --> 01:50:45.240
and microbes on return craft and so on and so forth

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:49.720
so wow how convenient is that yes it sounds crazy

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.760
what is currently being promoted i might add is

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:59.160
is fantastically more obscene right but you know i i do want to say that

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:03.400
these things that i'm putting out there as ideas none of this was on my

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:07.080
radar none of it so even though these things may be

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:10.600
crazy and i may be wrong i can honestly say

01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:15.640
that i've arrived at some of these possibilities as a result of close

01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:21.000
and inductive study of data of contemporaneous reports of of different

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:25.400
things again that doesn't make me right but the silence

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:30.280
the silence so interesting i you know i consider myself

01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:34.840
you know a historian basically of this event

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:39.160
we'll see how long this pursuit lasts but i'm horrified by it but i i

01:51:39.160 --> 01:51:43.320
legitimately want to know what happened because this event was used

01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:48.200
to scare everybody and to justify the need for for a shot

01:51:48.200 --> 01:51:52.520
that was forced on millions of people millions of people

01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:57.080
and was harmful you know moral injury if nothing else uh hundreds of millions

01:51:57.080 --> 01:52:01.560
yes yes yes a shot a technology which has been in the

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:05.320
works for a long time

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:11.000
uh decades with trillions of dollars behind it

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:13.800
i'm so thankful that you're going through this data

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.600
and continuing to highlight it uh there's going to be the silent treatment

01:52:18.600 --> 01:52:21.560
you're seeing that right now the ignoring

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:25.960
and you probably feel this right every day there's an attempt to

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:31.400
try to drown out the work you've done by just promoting more stuff out there

01:52:31.480 --> 01:52:34.760
you know it's as if you have to just keep like patty could get to keep putting

01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:40.120
your hand up on the top of the stack otherwise it very quickly

01:52:40.120 --> 01:52:43.880
uh gets uh people will forget about it and i think that's the goal right now

01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:48.600
to have more theories more stage controversy within the movement

01:52:48.600 --> 01:52:52.440
i think it's i'm really trying to ignore all i'm really trying to do my best to

01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:55.480
ignore a lot of that i don't know if you saw that the

01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.760
statement last week um last week that we put out the the

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:02.680
panda the panda put out like just about you know the

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:06.440
the state of all things covid and kind of where the organ like a like a

01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:10.040
position statement review review what the statement is

01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.280
sure well and it's it's a statement basically on

01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:18.600
what what does panda as an organization in in general

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:23.560
you know believe at this point in time about the nature of the events in the

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:28.920
covid era and so the statement jonathan angler was the

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:33.400
the lead architect and right around that many different people contributed to

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.160
it including myself it's you know subject to change right

01:53:37.160 --> 01:53:41.880
in in light of new evidence but we um the statement asserts that

01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:46.360
there's no pandemic here's why we say that we don't see

01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:50.840
um evidence of something novel spreading here's what we mean by that

01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:55.800
we don't think you know lab leak is really the right question

01:53:55.800 --> 01:54:00.520
here's here's why here's our position on you know whether there was a novel

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:03.640
disease so you know several things it's not

01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.880
too long of a document it's very well organized it's on panda.org or on the

01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:12.040
panda uncut substack.com people could people can find it they can

01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:16.840
comment it on it there um but i i like that i like

01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:20.760
and you know there's some things that i you know would if i was writing a

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:23.960
statement well i couldn't write this statement myself but if i could

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:26.680
uh you know there's a few things maybe that i would

01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:32.680
change but overall with my personal views but overall it largely represents

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.440
you know my current view on things too and that's awesome

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:41.640
we just need more of an inquiry stance here more humility more like can we

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:44.120
figure this out together because right now like

01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.960
there the people who pulled this off really pulled this off

01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.920
keep up the great work um anything i can do to to support our archive if you will

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:55.560
