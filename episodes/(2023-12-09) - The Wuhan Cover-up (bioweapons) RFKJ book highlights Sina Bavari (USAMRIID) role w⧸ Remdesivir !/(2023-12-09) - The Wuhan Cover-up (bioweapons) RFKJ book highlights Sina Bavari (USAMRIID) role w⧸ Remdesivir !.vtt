WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.300
We'll get on to that again right now.

00:50.300 --> 01:08.780
Good evening. Happy Friday, everybody. 8.25 p.m. 8.25 p.m. In the evening on Friday, December,

01:08.780 --> 01:20.380
the 8th year, 2023, very busy day on my end. But for those who sent some prayers, thank

01:20.380 --> 01:32.260
you so much. I think it's I'm just going to say thank you and we're at peace right now

01:32.260 --> 01:39.340
and it's good. It's good. I shouldn't even say that. Now people are going to be intrigued.

01:39.340 --> 01:47.820
But anyways, the name of tonight's episode is the Wuhan cover up by our weapons. RFK,

01:47.820 --> 01:56.860
whoops, those type of there, the RFK Junior book highlights Cinebavari and of you, Sam

01:57.020 --> 02:10.980
and his role with respect to Remdesivir. So I have a copy of the Wuhan cover up book that

02:10.980 --> 02:17.940
you can see here on the screen. This is my Kindle viewer. I'm going to scoot off the

02:17.940 --> 02:27.180
side here a little bit more on the screen. And there's many different subtopics to this

02:27.180 --> 02:41.940
sub sections to this particular topic. A couple of things for the record. I am actually in

02:41.940 --> 02:50.020
pretty much disagreement with the general premise that there can be biological weapons,

02:50.020 --> 03:00.420
which can be unleashed and will simply ripple through the population endlessly without stopping.

03:00.420 --> 03:13.300
Can you make a weapon using biological resources? Absolutely. Are there ways to get people to be

03:13.300 --> 03:23.860
ill with various bacteria by food contamination or potentially by aerosolization? Absolutely.

03:24.740 --> 03:30.660
Are there ways that people's health can be compromised by the use of all of the different

03:30.660 --> 03:36.020
types of chemicals which are in our environment? And things to me, people may be exposed to like

03:36.020 --> 03:45.700
in an airport or whatever, absolutely, and so on and so forth. However, the possibility of a

03:45.700 --> 03:51.300
virus coming out of a laboratory intentionally or unintentionally or even out of a garage and

03:51.300 --> 03:58.660
simply rippling through the entire world population and coding everyone in RNA is absolutely

03:58.660 --> 04:08.500
ridiculous. And so without even getting into that part of the book, sorry, total disagreement

04:08.500 --> 04:20.580
there. The second thing though is that we can get into all the negatives. But I will say

04:21.380 --> 04:30.740
totally upfront that there have been some extremely positive things which have come out of guidance

04:30.740 --> 04:37.860
related to overall health that have been advocated by some people within children's health events,

04:38.660 --> 04:44.900
which has made a very positive impact myself and other people who matter a lot to me.

04:45.620 --> 04:55.220
So I remain on the side of certainly they're not the only organization in the world which is

04:55.220 --> 05:07.540
seeking to promote or these claims to promote beneficial health to get involved with various

05:08.420 --> 05:18.260
state and federal policies, not at all, certainly not aware of all. However, they do just happen

05:18.260 --> 05:24.980
to be the one which gave visibility to some people involved in the facts film that have given support

05:24.980 --> 05:33.140
to amazing individuals such as Brian Hooker, which have led to us listening and doing more

05:33.140 --> 05:39.220
research and making decisions which we are incredibly thankful for.

05:40.580 --> 05:48.340
I'm not interested in this constant barrage of emails that I get that I must criticize

05:48.340 --> 05:54.180
every aspect of this organization. Find me an organization out there that doesn't have corrupt

05:54.180 --> 06:01.620
people. Sorry, it's everywhere. However, there is only one organization that at least had some

06:01.620 --> 06:06.340
people in the right place at the right time that have had a very positive impact.

06:07.860 --> 06:16.100
So that's that. I don't know what else to say. If you want to take it in another direction,

06:16.100 --> 06:22.420
that's fine. But there's almost nothing that anyone can say that's going to make me

06:22.900 --> 06:32.340
feel as though we've made a mistake because we just didn't. So I had just had to put those two

06:32.340 --> 06:38.580
things up front. Now this book here always only be released this week. It was a long time in

06:38.580 --> 06:44.180
development. The primary author is considered to be Robert of Kennedy Jr. And there was a multiple

06:44.180 --> 06:52.660
of additional contributing authors and book reviewers. Some I believe I know are at Children's

06:52.660 --> 06:59.940
Health Defense. Some are volunteers. Some may not be. I haven't evaluated the whole book front to

06:59.940 --> 07:06.100
back. However, when new books come out, such as this, one of the first things that I tend to do

07:06.100 --> 07:13.540
is I go to the search and I there's like 50 or 100 words that I search for and I'm just curious

07:14.260 --> 07:20.980
if the books mentioned these particular words or these particular names. And oftentimes they don't

07:22.260 --> 07:28.340
or it's minimal at best. And then usually my enthusiasm for reading the book or these urgency

07:28.340 --> 07:34.660
tends to go down. Not that they there isn't good stuff in here. It just means that it's going to be

07:34.660 --> 07:47.220
harder to dig out. And to my surprise, if you go to this book here, and if you type in this

07:47.220 --> 07:58.980
beautiful word b-a-v-a-r-i, boom, you will get three hits. So there's a translation of printed book

07:58.980 --> 08:07.780
page two, Kindle page, which of course differs based upon how you how large the letters are and

08:07.780 --> 08:17.860
so on. So I don't know how to do that translation, but as I have it opened here on page 282 of 986,

08:19.220 --> 08:27.780
just beforehand, it starts off with talking about Ralph Perrick and I'll start here. And I'm just

08:27.780 --> 08:31.380
excited to read about the scene above our part. This is not going to be a long video,

08:31.380 --> 08:35.460
and I'm just going to add a few comments at the end. That'll be it. I'm not looking at the the

08:35.460 --> 08:45.300
chat this evening. So in fact, Ralph Perrick and Ralph Perrick, University of North Carolina,

08:45.300 --> 08:54.500
longtime professor, researcher, scientist, we lovingly call him King clone here because he's a he's a

08:54.500 --> 09:01.620
big guy. And what he does, he clones things. That's what he does. He knows how to get

09:01.620 --> 09:10.580
fine replication competent molecules. However, you wanted to find them. He knows how to get things

09:11.140 --> 09:19.060
cloned. One of the better people out there at that. In fact, Ralph Perrick has trained

09:19.140 --> 09:26.340
his Wuhan lab counterparts in the secrets of genetically engineering pandemic coronaviruses.

09:26.900 --> 09:32.980
So as you can see right there, there is no there is no pandemic coronaviruses. I'm sorry.

09:33.940 --> 09:42.740
Sorry though. He taught them how to clone large quantities of stable synthetic viruses from small

09:42.740 --> 09:48.020
snippets of genetic information, how to employ his secret techniques for engineering infectious

09:48.020 --> 09:55.860
clones, by transferring spike proteins, genetically engineered to enhance viral infectivity in human

09:55.860 --> 10:02.260
cells from one back coronavirus to another, and how to do the quote, seamless ligation,

10:02.260 --> 10:05.940
unquote, that conceals the evidence of human tampering.

10:07.540 --> 10:13.700
Quote conspiracy theorists on quote or even mere cynics might suspect that shrewd

10:14.500 --> 10:22.260
self interest motivated barracks full hardy fool hardy gifts to the Chinese before

10:22.260 --> 10:29.380
teaching Wuhan lab scientists how to weaponize the spiked protein. Now it's the spiked protein.

10:29.380 --> 10:32.260
I thought it was a spike protein. It's the spiked protein.

10:33.860 --> 10:38.340
Weaponized the spiked protein. You know someone out there eventually has to make like an energy

10:38.420 --> 10:44.020
shake or like the spiked protein. I mean, it's just a it's a market opportunity waiting to happen.

10:44.820 --> 10:50.180
The spike protein to supercharge the pandemic pathogens. Again, don't believe in path path

10:50.180 --> 10:59.540
pandemic pathogens nonsense. In 2015, Barric filled a patent on the engineered spike protein that he

10:59.540 --> 11:06.340
had developed, giving him potential ownership and royalty claims on the vaccines and therapeutics

11:06.340 --> 11:13.140
that might be sold in any pandemic arising from his engineered viruses. Narrators know.

11:18.980 --> 11:26.820
Does anyone actually think that the entire world was turned upside down and as we're supposed to

11:26.820 --> 11:33.860
believe 17 million people were killed? Because one scientist wanted to make a few hundred thousand

11:33.940 --> 11:40.580
dollars or a few million dollars. Does anybody actually believe that garbage?

11:42.740 --> 11:49.300
Get to you? Do you believe 9-11 was because one Jewish guy in New York City wanted to make a

11:49.300 --> 11:55.940
billion dollars in insurance money? Do you really think coronavirus because Ralph Barric wanted to

11:56.020 --> 12:04.100
make some stock, make some money on stock investments? This is the lamest, weakest, hilarious,

12:05.060 --> 12:09.860
narrative option out there. I can't believe people still believe this crap.

12:12.020 --> 12:19.780
I'm sorry. If you want to believe that money had something to do with this, consider this.

12:20.740 --> 12:31.220
Pharma companies probably saved anywhere between five to a hundred trillion dollars

12:32.660 --> 12:42.020
by not having to enroll the world population into trials to make gene therapy live. They won't have

12:42.020 --> 12:46.900
to pay out for the people who were duped into taking medicine that injured them. They won't have

12:46.980 --> 12:52.340
to pay out the debts because they managed to recategorize gene therapy as vaccination.

12:53.220 --> 13:00.500
They saved trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars. They killed people because of it.

13:01.540 --> 13:08.660
If you think money is because is why this all happened, look at that and you know what,

13:08.660 --> 13:19.300
that doesn't involve Ralph Barric, really. Anyways, continuing on. The National Institutes

13:19.300 --> 13:29.860
of Health also owned patent March in Rights. That's a weird sentence. Also owned patent

13:30.500 --> 13:38.020
March in Rights in the Moderna vaccine by virtue of their NIAID grants that funded the mRNA platform

13:38.100 --> 13:41.620
in 2021, the National Institutes of Health as the United States

13:42.420 --> 13:47.060
took the unprecedented step of demanding that Moderna give co-ownership rights

13:48.340 --> 13:55.540
to the United States government. Ralph Barric also further hedged his bets against the eventuality

13:55.540 --> 14:02.900
of such a coronavirus pandemic via patent claims to the only emergency use authorization approved

14:02.900 --> 14:11.540
antiviral remdesivir. Oh, oh, oh, oh, so it's not because of the anti-viral that

14:12.180 --> 14:17.220
it's antiviral investment money. That's the whole pandemic is Ralph Barric.

14:22.580 --> 14:25.940
Man, I just can't believe people believe this stuff.

14:32.980 --> 14:38.100
You might as well just say it was because of Britney Spears. I mean, it's just this is tabloid level

14:38.100 --> 14:48.660
garbage. I'm sorry. That is such a ridiculous statement. Ralph Barric, oh, yeah, Ralph Barric

14:48.660 --> 14:55.460
also further hedged his bets against the eventuality of such a coronavirus pandemic via patent claims

14:55.460 --> 14:59.700
to the only emergency use authorization approved antiviral remdesivir. The National Institutes of

14:59.700 --> 15:05.380
Health should also have margin rights to patent royalties to remdesivir by virtue of funding

15:06.340 --> 15:10.980
the research for its development and then granting emergency use authorization for its use.

15:11.860 --> 15:18.660
However, a government accounting office report concluded that, quote, giliad collaborations

15:19.460 --> 15:23.140
was government scientists with respect to remdesivir.

15:23.140 --> 15:33.300
A shift pager generated no intellectual property rights for federally funded

15:33.300 --> 15:40.580
researchers or government agencies. Ralph Barric and his university and his university,

15:40.580 --> 15:46.580
University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, developed remdesivir. No, they didn't. Well,

15:46.580 --> 15:50.580
they developed it. Did they invent it? It was actually invented by someone down in Alabama,

15:50.580 --> 15:57.140
I believe, University of Alabama, which is meant to be a broad spectrum antiviral, although

15:58.420 --> 16:01.780
although a partnership with National Institutes of Health and Giliads,

16:01.780 --> 16:05.620
excuse me, through a partnership with National Institutes of Health and Giliad Sciences.

16:06.660 --> 16:10.900
Those clinical trials took place in the United States, China, France, Italy, and the United

16:10.900 --> 16:17.860
Kingdom as part of that deal. China got to copy the remdesivir formula for a Chinese pharmaceutical

16:17.860 --> 16:26.260
company called Bright gene. Remdesivir reportedly showed promise in preventing the replication

16:26.260 --> 16:32.020
of Ebola in lab tests, but it had the disadvantage of increasing rather than decreasing the human

16:32.020 --> 16:39.700
death rate. In 2019, the safety board pulled it from an African study as two toxic, even the

16:39.700 --> 16:47.220
treat Ebola, which typically kills 50% of those infected. 53% of the people who got remdesivir died.

16:47.940 --> 16:54.020
In April of 2019, a former postdoc of barracks, Ralph Barracks, named Alison Tatura,

16:54.660 --> 16:59.940
and the head of U.Sammerd, should have been, excuse me, should have been the scientific director of

16:59.940 --> 17:06.740
U.Sammerd, Cina Bavari, co-wrote a paper suggesting that the next pandemic would be a coronavirus

17:06.740 --> 17:12.340
and that remdesivir would likely be useful. Despite the fact that physicians and scientists

17:12.340 --> 17:17.140
had deemed it to poisonous for treating Ebola and Barak and Denison had previously published data.

17:17.940 --> 17:22.820
That showed remdesivir would be of no benefit late in SARS infection.

17:27.700 --> 17:34.340
And it goes on to give a couple of quotes here. This next quote here is

17:40.020 --> 17:45.540
is a really interesting quote here. And so before I go back to the Cina Bavari part,

17:48.660 --> 17:53.940
it has been said, actually already in this document, and has been said elsewhere that Ralph Barrack

17:55.700 --> 18:02.500
is the lead or one of the main people pushing remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2.

18:05.220 --> 18:12.980
Now, what's noteworthy is what do you mean to push remdesivir under which circumstances?

18:13.860 --> 18:24.900
Now, remdesivir has been shown in a dish anyways to cause some interruption in cells, uptake,

18:24.900 --> 18:29.780
and processing of viruses or extracellular vesicles or whatever you want to call them,

18:29.780 --> 18:37.300
exosomes, et cetera. It does something. All right, it does have an impact. It has been speculated

18:37.300 --> 18:44.180
and hypothesized that one of the values of remdesivir could be if it was used by, let's say,

18:44.180 --> 18:54.980
a war warfighter soldier who is expecting to be or has been exposed to a synthetic biological

18:54.980 --> 19:02.500
agent, something which may cause a transfection of bad proteins or some other rippel on effect

19:02.500 --> 19:07.140
in their body. And by a heavy dose of remdesivir, shortly afterwards,

19:08.580 --> 19:15.220
may dramatically help, although it's toxic, maybe better than whatever the agent would have done

19:15.220 --> 19:24.420
without it. There's a wartime fighter value to remdesivir, potentially. The way remdesivir

19:24.420 --> 19:30.500
has been suggested to have been used with coronavirus is a late-stage therapeutic,

19:31.140 --> 19:37.700
after which time, if there was any virus, exosome, whatever, the frick you want to call it in the body,

19:37.700 --> 19:45.500
that cells were going to process. It's already gone. There is no, even if you believe in the narrative,

19:45.500 --> 19:51.500
there is no SARS-CoV-2 left. It's gone. All you have right now is whatever it caused the body to make.

19:51.500 --> 19:59.940
Why would you need remdesivir? If anything, you need a glass of clean water and some rest.

20:00.420 --> 20:04.820
You don't need remdesivir at that point. Remdesivir is only going to make things worse.

20:05.940 --> 20:11.780
And it was suggested to send people home from hospitals who were sick, wait until they get

20:11.780 --> 20:18.500
their sicker, come on back in, then give them remdesivir, if they test positive for antibodies

20:19.460 --> 20:27.140
from a PCR test. And then they people just get sicker from there. It was never meant to be a

20:27.220 --> 20:33.700
late-stage therapeutics, the wrong application for it. And in barracks-owned papers, it was

20:34.260 --> 20:39.780
said clear as day. And even Jengli Xi, the Chinese bat lady, was on these papers. It was said,

20:40.820 --> 20:48.340
it was no observed benefit in late-stage use of GS5734, the pre-branded name of remdesivir

20:49.300 --> 20:57.060
from Gilead, no noticeable benefit in late-stage use at all. They knew there was no

20:57.060 --> 21:04.260
benefit. Beric never wrote a paper, at least, not until the pandemic, anyways. That's said,

21:04.260 --> 21:09.300
hey, I have a great idea. Let's use remdesivir as a late-stage therapeutic. It never happened.

21:09.300 --> 21:18.100
That's a myth. It's a myth. It never happened. Anyways, so this quote that's included here

21:18.180 --> 21:26.100
pretty much picks up on that. Now, who has seen a Bavari? Oh boy, that's a long one here.

21:28.980 --> 21:38.740
Let's just go to the website here. Let me just pick up on this. And again, I think we'll be done

21:38.740 --> 21:53.780
in 25 minutes, I think. Oops. Okay, go to use.com. If you go to B-A-V-A-R-I,

21:53.780 --> 22:00.260
this is Cinebavari. Cinebavari is born in 1959. He's only a few months

22:01.060 --> 22:07.940
younger or older than Robert Malone. In fact, Robert Malone has collaborated

22:07.940 --> 22:14.020
a fair amount with Dr. Cinebavari. Bavari was the director. It's a scientific director,

22:14.020 --> 22:18.260
not the overall director, but the scientific director, which in some ways really is the

22:18.260 --> 22:26.260
director role of you, Sammered, the United States Army, medical. In the United States,

22:26.260 --> 22:32.180
Army, medical, infectious. I always get this one messed up. Research in student infectious

22:32.180 --> 22:39.060
diseases. So it's their bio warfare, biodefense branch, research the advantage of the US Army.

22:39.860 --> 22:46.020
And Cinebavari has been at use Sammered for over 25 years. It just so happens that after being the

22:46.020 --> 22:53.140
direct scientific director of use Sammered from like 2008 or 2009, he, starting in 2008 or

22:53.220 --> 22:59.700
2009, he quit, stepped down and left use Sammered in September or August of 2019.

22:59.700 --> 23:07.620
Pandemic time, interesting. Now, Bavari's work goes all the way back to anthrax.

23:08.180 --> 23:14.420
I do suspect that he was actually one level up a boss of Bruce Ivan's at one point,

23:14.420 --> 23:23.060
noteworthy. Cinebavari has worked rather extensively with Gary Naval, who was the first director

23:23.060 --> 23:28.900
of Anthony Fauci's vaccine research center and is now a co-founder of MODEX Therapeutics and

23:28.900 --> 23:36.020
NEDIC Massachusetts that's making tri-specific antibodies. And they will be of course made in

23:36.020 --> 23:44.420
people's own bodies using mRNA or DNA technology. He has collaborated with my Cal Corporation.

23:44.420 --> 23:49.460
Cinebavari has he has 350 or 350 to 400 published papers.

23:49.460 --> 24:01.700
Note worthy though, in the context of the RFK junior book that Cinebavari's very last paper

24:02.900 --> 24:12.580
at use Sammered, the last paper he had published, okay, is this. Rod Spectrum,

24:13.220 --> 24:22.180
coronavirus antiviral drug discovery. And it was written in August, 2018, accepted February 7,

24:22.180 --> 24:30.340
2019 and then published expert opinion on drug discovery. And in this research paper,

24:31.540 --> 24:41.380
it is laid out very clearly that they speculate that GS5734 Remdesivir,

24:41.380 --> 24:44.820
which became Remdesivir, which has never really worked for anything.

24:46.580 --> 24:51.060
Of all the compounds which have ever existed of all the molecules you've ever been studied

24:51.060 --> 24:57.860
for medicine, they suggest will most likely be the thing to work the best as a therapy.

24:59.860 --> 25:08.100
For a coronavirus pandemic, should one occur starting somewhere in China after a coronavirus

25:08.100 --> 25:20.020
jumped off of a bat in a wet market. It is the most specific projection of coronavirus

25:20.020 --> 25:29.620
in the world. This is more specific than Event 201. It's more specific than anything else I have

25:29.620 --> 25:38.820
read anywhere about SARS-CoV-2. And not only that, it even predicts Remdesivir will work as a

25:38.820 --> 25:44.260
therapy. It was never designed as a therapy. It was designed as an antiviral. An antiviral is not a

25:44.260 --> 25:53.860
therapy. A bullet-proof vest is not a therapy if you've been hit with a bullet. It's an

25:53.860 --> 26:00.820
anti-bullet mechanism. If a bullet has gone into your body, you treat it differently.

26:01.540 --> 26:05.460
You don't take a bullet-proof vest and then shove it into the hole, the bullet.

26:07.620 --> 26:15.060
It's so stupid. I can't believe people don't understand this crap. Anyways, there was some

26:15.060 --> 26:20.660
work that was done in a dish with MERS, and that gave them some metadata that

26:20.660 --> 26:22.500
potentially Remdesivir will work.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.780
Cinevari was also on the short list of people that was involved in giving

26:29.780 --> 26:37.620
compassionate use to America's technically patient zero of SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19, who was the

26:37.620 --> 26:44.900
Snowhomish County man who flew back from Wuhan January 15, 2020 and checked into the hospital

26:44.900 --> 26:50.740
in January 18, 2020, up in the Everett, Washington, which is just north of Seattle,

26:51.380 --> 26:58.020
Washington State, area of the United States. And it just so happened that that person whose

26:58.020 --> 27:02.020
name was never released and photo has never been released and addresses never been released

27:02.020 --> 27:05.700
had the absolute perfect textbook recovery to Remdesivir.

27:06.500 --> 27:13.940
Hmm. Also noteworthy that that is one of the two, actually one of the three bases,

27:14.900 --> 27:19.220
the three pillars of information which are used to have made Remdesivir the standard of care.

27:20.100 --> 27:30.100
The other one is Ralph is Cinevari's friend, Robert Malone, who ran the domain program

27:30.100 --> 27:34.980
at the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency, or for the United States Defense

27:34.980 --> 27:41.300
Threat Reduction Agency, while he was also consulting for BARDA and Rick Bright.

27:42.980 --> 27:49.700
Isn't that interesting? Particularly interesting because Cinevari got into a whole boatload,

27:49.700 --> 27:57.540
a whole lot of trouble by concealing all use-samred connections with the Defense Threat

27:57.540 --> 28:04.900
Protection Agency going back to 2014, 15, 16, and 17. He was almost fired several times because

28:06.020 --> 28:09.780
he wanted to control and it would not disclose what those associations were.

28:11.860 --> 28:18.740
And of course the third thing is the fact that there was some metadata that potentially some

28:20.100 --> 28:26.580
primates with mirrors showed some positive response to Remdesivir.

28:26.660 --> 28:34.260
And crazy enough those tests were run by a mutual friend of both Cinevari and Robert Malone,

28:34.260 --> 28:42.580
and that's Heinz Feldman. Isn't that remarkable? All three bases, the three bases of which

28:43.460 --> 28:49.140
all of the approval of Remdesivir is based, effectively, Robert Malone and Robert Malone's

28:49.140 --> 28:58.180
professional network. Wow. Now going back to the statements that I made earlier about there

28:58.180 --> 29:05.220
being no pandemics. There may be no pandemics, but there really was over 1 million excess deaths.

29:07.140 --> 29:14.340
So how can that be? Well maybe if medicine wasn't approved, which should never have been

29:14.340 --> 29:20.420
approved in the first place. There would be less deaths maybe if there were no changes in

29:20.420 --> 29:25.140
hospital protocols. Maybe if people were allowed to use existing medicines as flawed as they are,

29:26.100 --> 29:30.180
there wouldn't have been no excess deaths. And maybe if we didn't call

29:32.420 --> 29:38.740
flu deaths, COVID deaths, which in and of itself does not cause excess mortality,

29:38.740 --> 29:44.260
but you know what? Those missing flu deaths as far as the overall total goes are backfilled,

29:44.260 --> 29:49.940
with a massive surge in opioid related deaths within the United States of America.

29:52.020 --> 29:58.980
In other words, the approval of Remdesivir is one of the key parts of creating a narrative

29:59.620 --> 30:07.860
of a deadly spreading gain of function virus through which the only potential response

30:07.860 --> 30:12.180
can be emergency use authorization of a new era of vaccine technology.

30:12.180 --> 30:21.140
That being gene therapy and wrapping it back up to this cockamani idea that this is all because

30:21.140 --> 30:26.820
Ralph Berwick wanted to make some money. If you think money's behind it, think of the trillions

30:26.820 --> 30:32.980
and trillions of dollars, which were saved by not having to roll out gene therapy in an ethical

30:32.980 --> 30:39.060
above-boardway, compensating people for the injuries and deaths that it's causing. If you

30:39.140 --> 30:47.940
think money's behind it, you should be talking about this document all day long. And if you're not,

30:48.820 --> 30:54.900
you are a traitor to the United States of America. That's all I'm going to say everyone. I hope you

30:54.900 --> 31:00.260
have a wonderful weekend. This is great progress. I'm glad to see this out there. I'm very appreciative

31:00.260 --> 31:07.140
of it. I have differences of opinion, beliefs and many of this book, but whatever. You know what?

31:09.780 --> 31:14.020
I'm gracious for what I'm gracious and thankful for what we're getting. And I suggest you to be

31:14.020 --> 31:22.980
the same. I love you guys. Take care.

31:30.260 --> 31:33.140
you
